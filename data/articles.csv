https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/paul-ingrassia-withdraw-hearing,cnn,Trump’s nominee for whistleblower office is withdrawn after reports of racist texts,"Kit Maher, Kristen Holmes, Aileen Graef",2025-10-22T00:08:27.189Z,"Paul Ingrassia is no longer the nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel, two White House officials told CNN on Tuesday, after his chances of getting through the Senate confirmation imploded following reports of racist text messages that he allegedly sent to a group chat.

Ingrassia posted earlier Tuesday evening that he was withdrawing himself from his confirmation hearing “because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time.” He added that he appreciated the “overwhelming support” he received and that he “will continue to serve President Trump and this administration to Make America Great Again!”

His post came hours after Senate Majority Leader John Thune hinted that the White House would pull Ingrassia’s nomination following the reports of racist text messages. “I think they’ll have something official to say about that, but you know what we’ve said, and you’ll probably be hearing from them soon,” he told reporters at the White House.

Earlier Tuesday, a White House official told CNN his nomination was “under review.”

Thune said Monday night that he hoped the White House would pull the nomination after Politico’s reporting on the messages. “He’s not going to pass,” Thune added of Ingrassia, whom Trump nominated in May to lead the independent agency tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers and enforcing civil service laws.

Ingrassia was set to appear before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday for his confirmation hearing, but one Republican senator on the panel had already announced he’d vote against advancing the nomination.

“No, I do not support him,” Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Monday night. Scott’s opposition would have effectively sunk the nomination in committee, assuming every Democrat joined him.

On Tuesday, after Politico’s report, CNN’s KFile reported that Ingrassia lost the support of the main Jewish group backing his nomination

Ingrassia, whose nomination had already drawn scrutiny, allegedly texted a group chat of other Republicans saying he has “a Nazi streak” and that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell,” according to Politico, which viewed the group chat.

Ingrassia’s lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, initially questioned the authenticity of the messages but added that if authentic, they were meant satirically.

“Looks like these texts could be manipulated or are being provided with material context omitted. However, arguendo, even if the texts are authentic, they clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call MAGA supporters ‘Nazis,’” he wrote in a statement to Politico.

“In reality, Mr. Ingrassia has incredible support from the Jewish community because Jews know that Mr. Ingrassia is the furthest thing from a Nazi,” Paltzik added. In a subsequent statement to Politico, he said, “there are who cloak themselves in anonymity while executing their underhanded personal agendas to harm Mr. Ingrassia at all costs,” and that “we do not concede the authenticity of any of these purported messages.”

KFile has previously reported on Ingrassia’s history of racist invective and conspiratorial rants, and affinity for a well-known White nationalist and Holocaust denier. His nomination had drawn scrutiny over his past promotion of conspiracy theories and tweets from his podcast that included calls for martial law following Trump’s 2020 election loss and harsh anti-Israel rhetoric aimed at the GOP. Ingrassia also argued publicly that “straight White men” are the most intelligent demographic group and should be prioritized in education.

Amid KFile’s initial reporting in July, the Trump administration insisted that Ingrassia had the backing of “many Jewish groups,” listing four — but most of those groups told CNN in July that they do not support him.

On Tuesday, Morton Klein — president of the main Jewish group that had been backing Ingrassia’s nomination, Zionist Organization of America — told CNN in a statement, “If these text revelations are accurate, I have no choice but to immediately withdraw my support. In this time of a surge and growing antisemitism, it is incumbent upon all of us to fight even any hint of antisemitism or racism.”

Ingrassia, who was admitted to the bar only last summer, held a brief White House internship during Trump’s first term. This year, Ingrassia first worked as a White House liaison at the Justice Department before reportedly being pushed out and reassigned to the Department of Homeland Security.

He would have marked a sharp departure from previous heads of the OSC, a role designed to be politically independent and to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. Rather than a long record of managerial or prosecutorial experience, typical of those who previously held the job, Ingrassia brought a fervent loyalty to Trump and a lengthy record of inflammatory statements.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/government-shutdown-congress-federal-workers-analysis,cnn,What’s happening to end the government shutdown? Nothing,Stephen Collinson,2025-10-21T04:00:51.237Z,"Democrats are talking to their voters who are desperate to fight. Republicans rarely reach beyond their base. And President Donald Trump, supposedly the world’s greatest dealmaker, is tuned out.

This Washington stasis explains why no end is in sight to a government shutdown now tied for the second-longest ahead of Trump’s expected departure for Asia at the end of the week for summits. There’s no sign he’ll emulate his first predecessor, President Barack Obama, who canceled a tour of the region in 2013 because of a similar stalemate.

“Plan B is open up the government,” Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN’s Manu Raju on Tuesday, pledging to continue to pressure Democrats to accept a short-term House spending bill they’ve been blocking to try to force Republicans to extend expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.

As Congress keeps doing the same thing, with the same inconclusive result, the costs of the partial closure of federal operations are escalating.

Hundreds of thousands of government workers are furloughed. The administration has fired several thousand more . On Monday, most specialists who oversee the US nuclear stockpile at the National Nuclear Security Administration got furlough notices . More air traffic control staffing shortages were reported over the weekend, in an ominous foreshadowing of potential travel crunches if the impasse drags on until Thanksgiving. And time is ticking down to the expiry of critical nutrition support for 42 million Americans next month.

Significant pain is being inflicted on federal workers who have mortgages and car payments coming due and on millions of citizens who rely on the government. But it hasn’t yet reached leaders in both parties in sufficient volume to force them to seriously negotiate on a reopening. Three weeks in, neither side has moved beyond the first stage of shutdown politics — blaming the other.

Democrats have succeeded in using the shutdown to create a platform for their demands for Republicans to agree to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies , without which millions of policies will shoot up in price at the end of the year.

“This is day 20 of the Trump Republican shutdown and the government remains closed because Republicans have zero interest in actually providing affordable health care to everyday Americans,” House Democratic Minority leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday. “That’s the challenge that the country faces right now.”

But how do Democrats turn their success in elevating a key issue into a meaningful political victory? Republicans aren’t shifting an inch on their refusal to hold talks on Obamacare subsidies until the government is opened — thereby depriving Democrats of leverage. And calls by some House progressives for multiyear extensions of the subsidies before the standoff ends appear rather optimistic.

Centrist Democratic senators, who might be looking for a way out, saw their position complicated this weekend by “ No Kings ” protests targeting Trump . They can hardly reach a compromise that looks like caving to the president after an estimated 7 million people got off their couches on Saturday to blast him as a wannabe dictator.

But Democratic attempts to split the usually deal-hungry Trump from Republicans in Congress have so far failed.

“What’s the way out of it? Trump,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the podcast “The Checkup,” according to a transcript released by his office. But Democrats are proving less successful than Russian President Vladimir Putin at getting the commander in chief to change his mind. He’s expected to lunch with GOP senators at his new “Rose Garden Club” terrace at the White House on Tuesday in a show of GOP unity.

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker told CNN on Tuesday that Trump was absent from discussions. “He’s getting ready to do another trip overseas to negotiate on foreign policy issues. What he should be doing is calling Democrats to the White House and negotiating with us,” Booker said. “The urgencies are growing. But where is the president? Why is he doing nothing? Why isn’t he sitting down with people? Why isn’t he understanding that there’s no Democrat or Republican way to do this? It’s only a bipartisan way,” Booker said.

Republicans, meanwhile, are enjoying their daily media appearances in which they slam Democrats for closing the government. House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday kept his speechwriters busy finding new superlatives, accusing the opposition of pulling off the “most selfish, most dangerous political stunt in the history of the United States Congress.”

But Johnson is no closer to solving the GOP’s own conundrum. How does the party in power escape blame for huge hikes in Obamacare premiums if the subsidies expire? That tough reality explains why Democrats believe Trump, already blamed for massive Medicaid cuts , may eventually fold. And Republicans do understand the political threat. At the weekend, they twinned their willingness to talk about a solution — if the government reopens — with a call to reshape the 15-year-old health-care law, even though they’ve never proposed a viable replacement.

“I have said that I’m absolutely open to having conversation, but we’re not going to extend a program that is wrought with fraud, waste and abuse,” Alabama Sen. Katie Britt told Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday. “Our health care system is broken, the system that they put in place,” she said.

This will only make Democrats more wary of a deal. Reform of the ACA sounds a lot like a fresh attempt by the GOP to finally kill a law the party has been trying to eradicate since it was an idea in the 44th president’s first campaign.

In the absence of any serious discussions to end the shutdown, political games are escalating on Capitol Hill.

Johnson is keeping the House dark, arguing that his members did their job by voting last month to temporarily fund the government, apparently ignoring all the other duties of the people’s representatives. “I refuse to allow us to come back and engage in anything until the government’s reopened,” the speaker said Sunday on ABC News’ “This Week.”

One reason Johnson might not want his members in town is they could spoil his attempt to stifle dissent after complaints about the shutdown spilled out from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and others. He’s also refusing to swear in new Democratic member Adelita Grijalva , who has pledged the deciding signature to force a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, until the House fully returns to Washington.

Democrats are meanwhile arguing that as terrible as the shutdown is, they are alleviating even greater misery by fighting to extend health care subsidies. In an odd way, the extreme realities of life in Trump’s Washington might be mitigating some of the political duress that usually boils up to end shutdowns. Furloughs of federal workers don’t seem so extreme after thousands were already fired in Trump’s federal government purge. And at a turbulent moment when Trump is trying to send troops into cities and posting bizarre AI videos, the rituals of a government shutdown seem routine by comparison.

In a futile and now-familiar dance unlikely to be noticed much outside the Senate chamber, Thune held a vote to pass a stopgap funding bill to reopen the government Monday evening. But Democrats stood firm for the 11th time, depriving the measure of the 60 votes needed to break the filibuster.

Thune may also bring up a bill this week to pay essential workers required to show up during the shutdown. The move might put Democrats in a tough spot. But they are likely to oppose any move that would allow Trump to pick and choose which workers get salaries. And in a signal that not all Republicans are on board with their leader’s strategy shift, Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville argued Tuesday that the bill could alleviate incentives to end the crisis.

Trump has already announced that his administration has shuffled existing funds to paying military personnel and FBI officers, two of the few categories of government workers about whom he seems to care.

His move lifted one of the usual sources of political heat that usually end up solving shutdowns. None of the others are working either.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/21/politics/justice-department-trump-compensenation,cnn,Trump says he ‘could be’ seeking $230 million from his own Justice Department,Kit Maher,2025-10-21T23:39:45.854Z,"President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he “could be” seeking $230 million from his own Justice Department as compensation for past investigations into him, though he professed to have little knowledge of the specifics and said he would give the money to charity.

“It could be,” Trump responded when asked by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins about a New York Times report that he was seeking the money in connection with complaints he had filed about past DOJ investigations.

“I don’t know about the numbers. I don’t even talk to them about it. All I know is that they would owe me a lot of money. But I’m not looking for money. I’d give it to charity or something,” Trump said in the Oval Office.

Though many of the details remain unclear, Trump acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the situation in which he would be potentially “paying himself” damages to resolve claims that the Justice Department under his predecessor had wronged him.

“With the country, it’s interesting, because I’m the one that makes the decision,” Trump said Tuesday.

“It’s awfully strange to make a decision where I’m paying myself. In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you’re paying yourself in damages?” he said.

A settlement to Trump would come from taxpayer funds.

Trump has long claimed the Justice Department was weaponized against him, focusing his ire on the two federal indictments brought against him after his first term. Both cases were dropped after he won ree﻿lection last year.

Trump argued Tuesday that he was damaged by the investigations into him and suggested he deserved to be paid for that, but added that he’d give away the money or use it to renovate the White House .

“As far as all of the litigation … they probably owe me a lot of money, but if I get money from our country, I’ll do something nice with it,” he said.

The New York Times reported Tuesday on that Trump was seeking $230 million in compensation and that any settlement might be approved by Justice Department officials who defended Trump, or those around him, during the investigations.

Trump submitted the complaints in 2023 and 2024, before he was reelected, The Times report says. The first claim seeks damages for alleged rights violations including the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The second complaint focuses on Trump’s classified documents case — which was dismissed after he was reelected — including accusing the FBI of violating his privacy when it searched his Florida estate in 2022. CNN previously reported on that claim, which sought $100 million.

Asked to confirm the $230 million amount, a spokesperson for Trump’s outside legal team said only that “President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led Witch Hunts, including the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax and the un-Constitutional and un-American weaponization of our justice system by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers.”

It was not immediately clear what steps Trump or his legal team had taken more recently to press the Justice Department for a payment out of those complaints. According to The Times, both claims were filed as part of an administrative process that allows people who believe they have been wronged to seek compensation from federal agencies. That is different from a lawsuit filed in court and decided by a judge.

The No. 2 official at the Justice Department — Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche — worked as Trump’s lead criminal defense lawyer. Another top DOJ lawyer, Stanley Woodward, who runs the department’s Civil Division, represented a Trump co-defendant in the classified documents case.

In theory, both officials could be involved in discussions about paying a settlement to someone alleging wrongdoing.

Asked whether top Justice Department officials would be conflicted in this matter, DOJ spokesperson Chad Gilmartin told CNN, “In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.”

The Justice Department fired its ethics chief in July, part of a purge of at least a dozen employees who had worked with the special counsel who brought the federal indictments against Trump.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/mamdani-democratic-socialism-explained,cnn,"Democratic socialism, according to Zohran Mamdani",Zachary B. Wolf,2025-11-06T22:03:07.526Z,"New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was the Democratic party’s candidate in the election, but he proudly describes himself as a democratic socialist alongside left-wing lawmakers like Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

Mamdani quoted the most famous American socialist, Eugene Debs , in his acceptance speech Tuesday night and talked about doing more for “working people” as opposed to the rich.

There’s a fair amount of confusion and fear generated in the US by the term “socialist,” which is associated with repressive societies like Communist China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, USSR, North Korea or Cuba.

So it’s worth looking at what Mamdani and his supporters mean by it (think social programs in Western Europe) and also how the political right will use it against Democrats.

President Donald Trump, for instance, liked to call Mamdani a communist and has threatened to pull federal funding from New York City when Mamdani is mayor.

CNN’s Erin Burnett has talked to Mamdani multiple times about the term and his beliefs, including after he won the Democratic primary and after Trump tried to label Mamdani as a communist.

In June , Burnett asked Mamdani if he liked capitalism.

MAMDANI: No, I have many critiques of capitalism. And I think ultimately, the definition for me of why I call myself a democratic socialist is the words of Dr. King decades ago. He said, call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There must be a better distribution of wealth for all of god’s children in this country.

And that’s what I’m focused on, is dignity and taking on income inequality. And for too long, politicians have pretended that we’re spectators to that crisis of affordability. We’re actually actors, and we have the choice to exacerbate it, like Mayor Adams has done, or to respond to it and resolve it like I’m planning to do.

He frequently returns to that Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. quote to describe democratic socialism.

There is no easily discoverable transcript of the relevant speech, according to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute. But the quote did appear in press reports, including in the New York Times, around King’s speech to the May 1965 Negro American Labor Council convention.

Burnett countered that a lot of Mamdani’s fellow immigrants to the US come to the country to seek wealth. Does he not believe that’s part of the American dream?

MAMDANI : I think the dream at its core is a dream for stability in one’s life. And what you’re saying that you work hard enough and that you then reap the benefits — too many New Yorkers, and Americans for that matter, are working eight hours and then still feeling like they haven’t made enough money to keep living in the city they call home.

He told NBC News that no, he is not a communist, despite Trump’s repeated claims.

Communism, as expressed in “The Communist Manifesto,” supports the idea that there will be a class war in which private property and the means of production are seized for the public good. Think “Animal Farm.”

Democratic socialism does not support the notion of a class war and instead pursues socialist goals through democratic means.

Mamdani’s big policy ideas are all focused on making life more affordable for working people.

Mamdani also wants to increase taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers and on the city’s corporations, but those proposals would require approval by the state legislature. Read more on Mamdani’s policy ideas from CNN’s Gloria Pazmino.

There is some. Take his Debs quote, which opened his acceptance speech Tuesday night.

“I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,” Mamdani said, quoting Debs’ remarks in court after his conviction for violating a World War I era law that forbade interfering with military recruitment.

It was a sensational trial at the time. The Supreme Court would ultimately uphold the conviction and Debs would go on to run for president from his jail cell.

It’s worth reading a bit more from Debs’ remarks.

DEBS: I believe, Your Honor, in common with all Socialists, that this nation ought to own and control its own industries. I believe, as all Socialists do, that all things that are jointly needed and used ought to be jointly owned — that industry, the basis of our social life, instead of being the private property of a few and operated for their enrichment, ought to be the common property of all, democratically administered in the interest of all…

I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions of men and women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence.

It’s that notion of seizing the means of production to which Mamdani’s fiercest critics have pointed. In comments he made on a recorded session for student activists with Young Democratic Socialists of America in 2021, he said that was the “end goal” of socialists like him.

But he counseled activists to focus on popular proposals many people agree with like Medicare for All .

MAMDANI: The many things that we believe, some of them are already popular in this moment right now, right? If we’re talking about the cancellation of student debt, if we’re talking about Medicare for All, these are issues which have the groundswell of popular support across this country. But then there are also other issues that we firmly believe in, whether it’s BDS (b oycott, divestment and sanctions ), right? Or whether it is the end goal of seizing the means of production, where we do not have the same level of support at this very moment.

He suggested that people would ultimately be convinced of the end goal.

But that was a one-off comment in the midst of a Q and A session. When Mamdani made a video in the same period to explain his views of socialism, he did not talk about seizing the means of production, but rather looking out for human dignity.

MAMDANI: I’m a Democratic socialist, and what socialism means to me is a commitment to dignity, a state that provides whatever is necessary for its people to live a dignified life. So the typical big three that we talk about are housing, health care, education.

The US has a social safety net that was built up under the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson with his Great Society . It is intended to help all Americans maintain a standard of living. People pay into Social Security and then claim benefits in retirement or when they are disabled. They pay taxes that support Medicare and then get discounted health care in old age. Medicaid helps low-income families afford health care. SNAP benefits help people afford food. Clearly these programs do not go far enough for democratic socialists or a lot of other Americans.

Around one-quarter of voters in New York City’s mayoral election said in exit polls released Tuesday that they considered themselves to be democratic socialists. As an indication of how labels can be squirrely, 12% of those democratic socialists supported Andrew Cuomo, not Mamdani, in the race. It is a much more popular label in New York City than MAGA, which was self-applied by just 11% of voters.

Democratic socialism is less popular nationwide than it is in New York City. In a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released in September, 17% of Americans said they thought of themselves as a democratic socialist, on par with the 18% who thought of themselves as MAGA.

Americans’ views of socialism have been generally and steadily poor in recent decades. Just 36% had a positive view in 2010, according to Gallup . This year, 39% had a positive view. At the same time, views of capitalism have dropped, from 61% positive in 2010 to 54% today."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/affordability-trump-gop-analysis,cnn,Trump is trying to make ‘affordability’ his issue. Good luck with that.,Aaron Blake,2025-11-07T16:56:53.816Z,"President Donald Trump is nothing if not gifted at crafting politically advantageous alternate realities. Through repetition, force of will and shamelessness , he’s convinced tens of millions of Americans of a host of dubious or outright-false claims – most notably that the 2020 election he lost was somehow “stolen.”

But Trump’s latest effort to rewrite reality is brazen and puzzling even by his standards.

As inflation has proven stubborn, and even ticked up, and as energy and grocery prices have continued to rise , Trump has set about trying to convince people that this isn’t the case at all.

“I will say this: If you look at affordability, which they campaigned on, they lied,” Trump told reporters on Friday, referring to Democrats’ success in Tuesday’s election.

“Because they talked about, ‘Oh, prices are up.’ No, no. Prices are down under the Trump administration. And they’re down substantially.”

He’s arguing that the rising costs people can see and feel are actually down. And now he’s trying to make “affordability” his calling card.

Good luck with that.

Polls have made clear Americans not only overwhelmingly understand prices are rising, but they strongly link this to Trump’s policies.

What’s more, the president has allowed a particularly troublesome perception to fester: that he’s been asleep at the wheel.

It’s difficult to see how pretending that inflation doesn’t exist and that his administration has done a great job on this issue is going to change that. If anything, it could exacerbate a perception that the administration is divorced from reality.

Trump has responded to Republicans’ poor 2025 election results by suddenly keying like a laser on “affordability.” He might not have much regard for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s democratic socialist policies, but he seems happy to rip a page out of Mamdani’s political playbook.

“Why did Zohran Mamdani do so well last night? He relentlessly focused on affordability,” top White House political adviser James Blair told Politico on Wednesday.

Trump’s MAGA ally Vivek Ramaswamy, who is running for Ohio governor, cut a video on election night urging Republicans to set aside their focus on culture wars in favor of an affordability focus .

Trump has posted on social media and spoken repeatedly about affordability in the last few days, claiming on Friday that Democrats’ message on the topic was a “con job” and that Republicans need to do a better job talking about his economic successes.

“The only problem is the Republicans don’t talk about it, and Republicans should start talking about it and use their heads, because we have great numbers,” he said Thursday, claiming there’s “virtually no inflation.”

Trump has also repeatedly pointed to Walmart’s annual Thanksgiving grocery list costing under $40 this year compared to about $55 last year.

The talking point is a complete non sequitur , as CNN’s Daniel Dale writes. It’s not apples-to-apples because this year’s list has fewer items. And it’s clear that grocery prices writ large are up. In fact, average prices in September were up 1.4% compared to January and up about 3% since last year, according to a recent Consumer Price Index study. They also just saw their largest one-month year-over-year increase (0.6%) in three years this summer.

When pressed on the apples-to-oranges comparison of the Walmart Thanksgiving list on Friday, he dismissed the question as “fake news.”

But it’s not just that prices are up; it’s also that people recognize that, despite Trump’s claims.

A CBS News-YouGov poll last week showed just 7% of Americans said prices have been going down recently. Another 62% said they’re going up.

A Washington Post-ABC News poll, meanwhile, shows fewer than 10% of Americans say they’re paying less for groceries and utilities compared to a year ago. Conversely, 71% said they’re paying more for groceries, and 59% said they’re paying more for utilities.

And more than that, people draw a direct line from these price increases and economic pains to Trump.

All of which brings us to perhaps the one economic number that I keep coming back to on this topic.

CBS has asked repeatedly during Trump’s second term whether he was focused enough on lowering prices.

The percentage who said he’s focused “not enough” on this has risen from 64% in March to 70% in July to 75% in October.

That’s three-quarters of Americans who haven’t seen Trump doing enough on this topic. Even a clear majority of Republicans – 57% – say Trump has neglected the issue.

These perceptions are baked-in now, in large part because Trump has neglected the issue, at least until he decided to start saying “affordability” a lot in recent days.

If anything, he’s given people a shorthand to tie him to this persistent inflation. That’s in part because he decided to make tariffs, which are often inflationary, his signature economic policy. And he decided to implement them unilaterally, making it clear exactly who is responsible for them. He voluntarily took near-complete ownership of the economy, and now he’s trying to pretend things have gone better than they have.

Trump might be able to convince some people that what they see with their own eyes at the grocery stores or on their electric bills isn’t real. Maybe he’ll get some MAGA Republicans to misremember prices being higher a year ago.

But when it comes to convincing the rest of the population they’re better off now, it’s really hard to see that working.

Trump’s alternate realities often resonate because Americans live in information silos where his claims aren’t fact-checked. That can work well when it comes to complex subjects like voter fraud.

But prices are things people can fact-check with their own eyes. They’re facts that are quite literally in people’s faces on a daily basis.

And ultimately, what Trump risks is instead convincing people that he’s out of touch with their economic realities.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/fact-check-beef-grocery-prices-trump-vis,cnn,"Fact check: Trump falsely claims it’s only beef, but dozens of groceries have gotten more expensive this year","Daniel Dale, Matt Stiles",2025-11-07T18:38:12.443Z,"President Donald Trump keeps saying beef is the only grocery product that has gotten more expensive during his second presidency.

“Groceries are down except for the beef, which I’ll get down too,” he said in a speech last week in Tokyo. “Groceries are way down, other than beef,” he said in a Fox News interview on Wednesday. “(Grocery prices) went up under Biden. Right now, they’re going down. Other than beef, which we’re working on, which we can solve very quickly,” he said in a CBS interview taped last week. “We have much lower prices than (Democrats) do, and we only have one thing, beef,” he said at the White House on Thursday.

Trump’s claim that grocery prices are down is wrong. And so is his claim that beef is the only grocery product that has increased in price.

Grocery prices are up , not down. Grocery prices have increased during Trump’s second term. Average US grocery prices in September were 1.4% higher than they were in January, the month he returned to office, and 2.7% higher than they were in September 2024 under former President Joe Biden, Consumer Price Index figures show . The 0.6% increase in average grocery prices from July 2025 to August 2025 was the biggest month-to-month jump in three years , and it was followed by a 0.3% increase from August to September.

It’s not just beef – not even close. The prices of dozens of grocery products increased from January to September. A smattering of products got cheaper, notably including eggs , but a far greater number of products got more expensive.

You can see the long list of increases in the graphic below.

“The president’s claims about grocery prices don’t align with the government’s own data,” Michigan State University professor David Ortega , a food economist, said in a Thursday email. He added, “While it’s true that beef prices have risen to record highs , they’re far from the only category seeing increases. … The reality is that prices for many everyday grocery items have increased in recent months, and tariff-related cost increases are now feeding through to consumers.”

Prices increased from January to September in five of the six overarching groups of grocery prices tracked by the federal government’s Consumer Price Index: meats, poultry, fish, and eggs (up 4.5%); nonalcoholic beverages and beverage materials (up 2.8%); cereals and bakery products (up 1.4%); fruits and vegetables (up 1.3%); and “ other food at home ” (up 0.8%). Only the dairy and related products group was down, declining 0.2%.

Grocery prices, like overall prices, tend to rise over time, and they can bounce around for all sorts of reasons unrelated to the actions of the president. But experts like Ortega say two of Trump’s signature policies have clearly contributed to this year’s increases: large and broad tariffs on imported goods ( including food and food packaging materials) and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants (who make up a large percentage of the US farm workforce ).

The price of uncooked ground beef was up 14.2% between January and September. There was an even bigger increase, 15.3% , in the price of coffee; coffee consumed in the US is almost entirely imported, and much of it is now hit with big tariffs .

On Friday, ICE posted a recruitment message to social media calling on police officers to “Defend the Homeland” and “work for a President and a Secretary who support and defend law enforcement—not defund or demonize it.”

ICE’s message references Mamdani’s history of police criticism, including his past support for defunding the NYPD. In June 2020, Mamdani posted on X: “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD.”

CNN has reached out to Mamdani’s transition team for comment.

Mamdani has also previously accused the NYPD of international corruption and collaboration with the state of Israel. In a 2023 clip Mamdani said, “We have to make clear that when the boot of the NYPD is on your neck, it’s been laced by the IDF.” In October, he told CNN he was referencing training tactics, and did not actually believe the NYPD was actively working with the IDF.

In the closing months of his campaign, Mamdani made a concerted effort to reach out to law enforcement and backtrack from his previous stances. He also committed to retaining current Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.

“I am not defunding the police. I am not running to defund the police,” Mamdani told reporters in August. Mamdani also publicly apologized to New York police officers, walking back past comments calling them “racist,” “wicked” and “corrupt.”

Mamdani has been a vocal critic of ICE, telling CNN he would not allow the NYPD to engage or cooperate with ICE on civil immigration enforcement.

ICE’s attempts to hire NYPD officers are the latest efforts from the Department of Homeland Security to hire thousands more deportation officers after receiving $75 billion in federal funding from Trump’s sweeping agenda bill this summer."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/07/politics/supreme-court-consider-same-sex-marriage-precedent-obergefell,cnn,Supreme Court to weigh longshot bid to overturn same-sex marriage precedent,John Fritze,2025-11-07T09:00:01.664Z,"The Supreme Court will meet behind closed doors Friday to consider a longshot bid to overturn its decade-old same-sex marriage precedent , an appeal that is churning fear among some LGBTQ advocates even though the justices themselves have repeatedly signaled little appetite for reopening the landmark decision.

The pending appeal comes from Kim Davis , a former county clerk from Kentucky who refused to issue marriage licenses after the Supreme Court’s blockbuster 2015 decision, Obergefell v. Hodges , allowed same-sex couples to legally marry. Davis, who has fought her case for years, has directly asked the court to jettison that decision.

“The time has come,” Davis argued in a recent filing, for a “course correction.”

The Supreme Court will meet Friday, like it often does this time of year, to consider which appeals it will hear in coming months and which it will deny. The Davis appeal is one of dozens of cases the justices will consider in that private meeting, and the court could announce as soon as Monday what it will do with the case.

It could also hold the appeal for weeks, which often happens when one or more justices want to write an opinion about a decision to deny a case.

“I am very concerned,” James Obergefell, the namesake of the landmark precedent, told CNN this week. “At this point I do not trust the Supreme Court.”

It is true that today’s Supreme Court is different – and far more conservative – than the one that decided Obergefell a decade ago. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key swing vote who authored that decision, retired in 2018 and was replaced by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a far more reliable vote for conservative outcomes.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal icon who was also in the Obergefell majority, died in 2020 and was succeeded by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative.

But despite public criticism of the opinion from a few conservative justices – including a sharply written concurring opinion three years ago from Justice Clarence Thomas , who called on his colleagues to “reconsider” same-sex marriage – plenty of other signs suggest the court is not ready to rethink the issue so soon after deciding it.

As she promoted a new memoir this fall , Barrett was repeatedly asked about Obergefell. While she repeatedly swerved around those questions, she told the New York Times last month there are “very concrete reliance interests” at stake when it comes to same-sex marriage.

One of the factors the Supreme Court considers when weighing the possibility of overturning a precedent is whether Americans have come to rely on the decision. In the case of same-sex marriage, those considerations could include factors like child custody and financial planning.

Justice Samuel Alito also discussed the 2015 decision last month, criticizing it as inconsistent with the originalist legal philosophy that the court’s conservatives today widely embrace. And yet Alito, who dissented in Obergefell, was careful to caution his audience not to read too much into his words.

“In commenting on Obergefell, I am not suggesting that the decision in that case should be overruled,” Alito said during a lecture in Washington, DC.

“Obergefell is a precedent of the court that is entitled to the respect afforded by the doctrine of stare decisis,” Alito said, using the Latin term for the principle of the importance of adhering to precedent.

The Obergefell decision prompted a massive celebration outside the Supreme Court on the day it was decided. That evening, the White House was lit up with rainbow-colored lights. Many same-sex couples rushed into courthouses the next day to wed. Nearly 600,000 same-sex couples have since married, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.

But some religious conservatives saw the decision as a betrayal. Davis, who at the time was the clerk of Rowan County in Kentucky, cited her religious objection to same-sex marriage as justifying her decision to withhold marriage licenses to all couples. She was sued by multiple couples in the county, and a jury awarded $100,000 in damages plus far more in legal fees. After a federal court found she had violated a court order to issue licenses, Davis was also thrown in jail for several days.

While virtually all of the attention around the Davis appeal has focused on her request to overturn Obergefell, the bulk of her case deals with a series of less dramatic questions. In appealing the damages verdict, Davis argues that the First Amendment’s religious protections should shield her from legal liability, particularly since she is no longer a public official. The 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that argument.

The Supreme Court could, in theory take up that technical – though still important – question and decline Davis’ request to consider overturning Obergefell.

It takes four justices to grant an appeal, but that number belies a practical reality. It takes five for a majority, which means even if there are four justices who want to hear a case, they must consider whether they can find a fifth vote to win.

Perhaps the more important question is whether the Davis petition is an opening salvo in a longer campaign against Obergefell that will slowly build, just like the ultimately successful effort by conservatives to overturn Roe v. Wade. On the one hand, cultural and political winds have shifted significantly on gay marriage in past decades. Three years ago, Congress passed a federal law protecting same-sex and interracial marriage with bipartisan support .

But opposition remains among some religious groups, which have enjoyed significant success at the Supreme Court in recent years.

“If not this case, it’s going to be another case,” said Mathew Staver, the founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a religious legal group representing Davis. “In my view, it’s not a matter of if but when it will be overturned.”

Mary Bonauto, a veteran civil rights attorney at GLAD Law who argued the Obergefell case , said she wasn’t surprised by that view.

“I’m not taking my eye off this issue, and neither is my organization,” Bonauto said. “You can never really rest on your laurels because other forces just don’t give up.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/abraham-accords-kazakhstan-trump,cnn,"Kazakhstan will join Abraham Accords, Trump announces","Tal Shalev, Jennifer Hansler, Betsy Klein, Alejandra Jaramillo",2025-11-06T18:50:41.306Z,"Kazakhstan is joining the Abraham Accords, US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday, although the country already has longstanding diplomatic relations with Israel.

“I just held a great call between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of Israel, and President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is the first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

The accords are Trump’s signature foreign policy accomplishment from his first term, and the White House is looking to expand the circle of countries that fall under the agreement.

The administration believes that Kazakhstan’s addition to the Abraham Accords will be “just the tip of the iceberg,” according to a source familiar with the matter.

“This is a major step forward in building bridges across the World,” Trump said as he announced the agreement. “Today, more Nations are lining up to embrace Peace and Prosperity through my Abraham Accords.”

He said a signing ceremony would take place “soon” to formalize the agreement.

The announcement, which came as Trump met with leaders of five Central Asian nations, marks the first country to join the Abraham Accords since 2020. But it’s unclear if there will be any substantive change or upgrade to the diplomatic relations Israel and Kazakhstan have had for decades.

Top Trump administration officials defended the significance of the agreement during the meeting, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio telling reporters that it constitutes an “enhanced relationship beyond just diplomatic relations and having embassies in each other’s capitals.”

“It is not just with Israel — it’s with all the other countries that are part of the accords, you’re now creating a partnership that brings special and unique economic development on all sorts of issues that they can work on together,” he added.

Vice President JD Vance argued that Kazakhstan’s agreement sent a broader message: “What the president has done is actually signaled that the momentum of the Abraham Accords is alive and well in the second administration.”

US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff hinted at the announcement Thursday during an appearance at a Miami financial conference.

“Abraham Accords - I’m flying back to Washington tonight, because we’re going to announce tonight another country,” Witkoff said, declining to provide specifics.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio also met with Tokayev. The two discussed “expanding opportunities for commercial trade and investment,” according to a readout of the meeting provided by the State Department.

Tokayev’s office said in a statement that Kazakhstan was ready to “engage in constructive dialogue on deepening multifaceted cooperation.”

The Trump administration has made the expansion of the Abraham Accords one of its top foreign policy goals. The accords saw Israel normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and others. The US is now trying to advance normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but Riyadh has made clear that it would only happen with a viable pathway to Palestinian statehood, something openly dismissed by Israel’s government.

Last month, Trump told Time Magazine that “Saudi Arabia will lead the way toward the Abraham Accords.” When asked whether he thought the country would join the accords by the end of the year, Trump responded, “Yes, I do. I do.”

https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/nancy-pelosi-congress-retirement,cnn,Nancy Pelosi announces she will not seek reelection to Congress after nearly 40 years in Washington,"Sarah Ferris, Dana Bash",2025-11-06T14:00:12.369Z,"Nancy Pelosi , the first and only female speaker of the US House of Representatives and one of the most powerful figures in Democratic politics for decades, has announced she will not seek reelection.

“I have truly loved serving as your voice in Congress, and I have always honored the song of St. Francis, ‘Lord make an instrument of thy peace,’ the anthem of our city. That is why I want you, my fellow San Franciscans, to be the first to know. I will not be seeking reelection to Congress,” Pelosi, 85, said Thursday in a sweeping video that stood as a love letter to the city she has represented for nearly 40 years in Washington.

“With a grateful heart, I look forward to my final year of service as your proud representative. As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power. We have made history. We have made progress. We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our Democracy and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.”

The announcement ends heightened speculation in recent days that the longtime Democrat would soon announce her intention to draw her congressional career to a close after 38 years. She was widely expected to leave Congress after this term, her first in decades as a rank-and-file member.

Reflecting on her many roles on Capitol Hill, Pelosi said Thursday: “I say to my colleagues in the House all of the time, no matter what title they had bestowed upon me – speaker, leader, whip – there has been no greater honor for me than to stand on the House floor and say, ‘I speak for the people of San Francisco.’”

Pelosi was first elected to Congress in 1987, and made history as the House’s first-ever female speaker in 2007. She remains the only woman to have wielded the gavel, which she earned after the 2006 and 2018 elections. Even now, decades after her ascent to the top of the House Democratic caucus, she remains one of the most influential voices in the party.

The congresswoman made public her decision to retire two days after one of her biggest political victories in recent years: a resounding win for a ballot measure in California that redraws the state’s congressional map to favor Democrats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. She personally raised tens of millions of dollars for the push, according to a person familiar with her fundraising efforts.

While Pelosi herself wasn’t on the ballot Tuesday, it was a fitting closing coda to a storied political career. The long-time Democratic leader has devoted her recent years in Congress — both as speaker and as a rank-and-file member — to fighting President Donald Trump and his remake of the Republican Party. In recent months, she worked furiously behind the scenes with her longtime friend, Gov. Gavin Newsom, to pass “ Proposition 50 ,” which won with a whopping 63% of the vote.

Raised in Baltimore’s Little Italy neighborhood, Pelosi grew up walking the halls of the Capitol, where her father served as a US congressman from Maryland. The daughter of one former city mayor and the sister of another, her colleagues have often attributed that upbringing to her sharp negotiating tactics and fierceness in politics.

She held an iron grip over Democrats in Congress — almost never losing a vote on the floor, which has been a regular occurrence under the House GOP — and used old-school tactics to keep that power, including exacting revenge on her rivals by blocking them from powerful committees. She never once faced a serious challenger in her time as speaker. (Behind the scenes, she encouraged endangered Democrats to run against her publicly if they needed to do so to win favor at home, telling them: “Just win.”)

Two years after Pelosi stepped back from House Democratic leadership under pressure to let the younger generation in the party lead, the longtime congresswoman is still widely regarded as one of the most powerful speakers in modern history. In her second term with the gavel, Pelosi presided over historic clashes with Trump, including congressional oversight battles that twice escalated to the level of a rare House impeachment against a US president. In one of her most infamous moments of Trump’s first term, Pelosi tore up a copy of the president’s State of the Union speech to Congress while sitting behind him during the nationally televised address.

The animosity between the two reached a new level after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, during which pro-Trump rioters stormed the complex and among the widespread destruction broke into Pelosi’s leadership suite and terrorized her staff.

The president on Thursday reacted to the congresswoman’s announcement by calling her “terrible,” “an evil woman” and “a tremendous liability for the country.”

Her legislative legacy, however, extends far beyond Trump. As a newly elected representative from San Francisco in the late 1980s, her maiden speech focused largely on fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Since then, her time in Congress has spanned seven presidents, during which she cast historic votes such on whether to authorize then-President George W. Bush’s nascent war in Iraq after the September 2001 terrorist attacks or to impeach then-President Bill Clinton. (Pelosi opposed both measures.)

After a steady climb up the leadership ladder, Pelosi first won the speaker’s gavel 18 years ago. Then, in 2019, Pelosi took the gavel again, becoming the first person to win non-consecutive terms as speaker in six decades.

“It is an historic moment for the Congress, and an historic moment for the women of this country,” Pelosi said in her first speech as speaker in 2007. “It is a moment for which we have waited over 200 years.”

Her time leading the House Democratic caucus included two separate stints during which the party held the White House and majorities in both the House and Senate. During those years of full Democratic control of Washington, Pelosi, alongside then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, followed by Chuck Schumer, muscled through enormous pieces of legislation, including the landmark Affordable Care Act, of which Pelosi’s team has described her as the “chief architect.”

She had a longtime and personal relationship with the most recent Democratic president, Joe Biden, and the two passed billions of dollars in new funding to help the nation recover from the Covid pandemic and expand programs, like the enhanced ACA subsidies now at the center of the government shutdown. But Pelosi notably withheld her support for Biden in the final months of his campaign and was also one of the senior Democrats who was privately helping to encourage him to leave the presidential ticket in the summer of 2024, worried about his ability to defeat Trump. (Former first lady Jill Biden later called Pelosi’s actions in the run-up to the election “disappointing” after 50 years of friendship.)

On Thursday, the former president publicly sent his well-wishes to Pelosi and praised her as “the best Speaker of the House in American history.”

“It’s why I awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom,” Biden wrote.

In her nearly four decades in office, Pelosi steered Democrats as more ardent redistricting efforts peeled away moderates in the party — nearly eliminating the southern Blue Dogs who once almost tanked the Democrats’ health care law. Now, the caucus represents a far more left-leaning party, with virtually no dissent on once-divisive issues like abortion or gay marriage.

Years after drafting that health care law, Pelosi then helped Democrats win back the majority in 2018, fueled by anti-Trump wave on a health care-driven message that was a direct result of the Trump administration’s repeated attempts to repeal the law.

She oversaw a time of rapid change in the party, as increased political polarization reshaped national politics. That included a sharp rise in political violence that struck her own family in 2022, in which her husband Paul Pelosi was violently attacked with a hammer by a man who broke into their San Francisco home. Paul Pelosi, who suffered a fractured skull, required surgery and underwent a long recovery. She later told CNN that the attack complicated her decision on whether to remain in party leadership at the time.

Pelosi does not often speak of the glass ceilings for women in politics or her own role in breaking them. But she has previously opened up to CNN about playing in what was traditionally a boys’ club of politics.

“I get some names called, because if you’re effective as a woman, then they have to undermine you, because that’s a real threat,” Pelosi said in an interview in 2018.

She reflected at the time on the importance of projecting confidence.

“You know why I do it? I do it, because I want women to see that you do not get pushed around. You don’t run away from the fight,” she said.

https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/snap-west-virginia-government-shutdown,cnn,‘How can food be political?’ Families in state that pioneered SNAP speak of hardship,"René Marsh, Dianne Gallagher, Michael Williams",2025-11-06T11:00:17.221Z,"Onita Norris is constantly running the numbers to try to solve a problem with no good answer: Figuring out much her two children, both under five, will have to eat, and how much she will have to go without.

The West Virginia single mother earns about $2,800 a month working 40 hours weekly for the state. About half of that goes toward rent. The rest is for daycare and her electric, water and phone bills, leaving her only about $100 from her paycheck for other expenses, including groceries.

Aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, usually adds $265 to her monthly budget for food. But with benefits disrupted  as the government lurches into what is now its longest shutdown on record, Norris now must find other ways to feed her family.

“Rather than myself having, like, a full plate of food along with my kids, I’m making sure that they have a full plate of food,” Norris said. “I may have either less, or I may not eat.”

Tears come to her face as she worries she’s failing her children. “It feels like I’m failing them because I am trying, I’m trying to do all that I can, and, of course, as a human you get frustrated,” she said, “and I never want my kids to see that, or feel like I’m taking that out on them, for something as simple as dinner.”

More than 40 million Americans rely on SNAP benefits, also known as food stamps, to pay for food. They are caught in the middle of a protracted budget  standoff between Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have, for more than a month,  been unable to come up with an agreement that would fund the government.

The difficult circumstances SNAP recipients are facing have become one of the most pressing issues for lawmakers, who are under pressure to work harder toward an agreement to get the benefits fully funded again.

In West Virginia, the state that was the first testing ground in 1961 for what is now SNAP, some 15% of its 1.7 million   residents rely on the benefits today.

Food banks in the state are struggling to meet demand. They were already dealing with budget cuts caused by federal belt tightening    toward the beginning of the year. Now, things are even more stretched as furloughed federal workers become new clients.

One charity in Martinsburg, CCAP/Loaves & Fishes, saw the number of households it serves roughly double from 72 households per week to 159 in the third week of October, and 119 in the fourth.

Even though it is better positioned than other pantries thanks to the generosity of the community and local churches, there are worries about how long it can continue to keep serving at such a rate.

“Until the SNAP benefits are replenished, the federal workers go back to work, we’re going to be just slammed like this all day,” its president, Leigh Fleming, told CNN.

Following a court order, the Trump administration earlier this week said it would partially fund SNAP for November. But the funds won’t cover full benefits, and November payments for millions of Americans who rely on them have been delayed.

Trump then appeared to threaten to withhold SNAP funding on Tuesday until Democrats voted to reopen the government. The White House later clarified the administration would follow through on its plan to fund partial food aid during the shutdown.

In West Virginia, the federal government’s responses have brought confusion and dismay.

“I just don’t feel as though the folks at Washington quite understand the gravity of the situation,” said Norris. “I just don’t understand how we’ve come to a point where we’re using food in politics and being essentially political pawns.”

Laura Bowles, a West Virginia mother of five children aged four to 13 — with a sixth on the way — said she had to explain to her older kids that “there are some right now in the government who can’t figure things out, and we can’t have everything we used to have right now.”

For her family, it means having to buy less food. “My kids eat a lot,” she said. “And groceries are already so expensive these days — it was already hard,” Bowles said. Like Norris, she is cutting back her own food intake to make her kids’ meals stretch further.

Her husband’s paycheck from Walmart, where he works full time and makes $14 an hour, usually covers all their household bills.

But this month, without SNAP, it’s mostly going to groceries. That means the family has had to pick what other bills to pay.

“I let my trash and internet bill slide already,” said Bowles. Only half the electricity and car insurance could be covered, she added, and the family are even cutting back on driving to the park to save money on gas.

“It’s a struggle out here. I am pregnant again, and that wasn’t part of the plan – but it was God’s plan,” she said. “I guess people struggle everywhere, but it’s hard here in West Virginia. It just feels extra hard here.”"
https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/politics/shutdown-impacts-snap-wic-parks-federal-worker-pay-analysis,cnn,23 effects being felt on Day 35 of the shutdown,Zachary B. Wolf,2025-11-04T09:00:00.833Z,"The current government shutdown is poised to become the longest in history. On Tuesday, it ties the 35-day record set in 2019, during President Donald Trump’s first term. With no serious negotiations happening, it’s a good bet the shutdown will continue for the foreseeable.

Many of the effects — like lapses in food aid for the lowest-income Americans — are just starting to be felt. Other impacts, like the cost to the economy of delaying billions in federal funding, may never truly be known.

Here are some of the more notable effects, from CNN’s reporting and as documented by other outlets, of what is officially tied for the longest US government shutdown in history.

More than 1 million federal workers aren’t getting paid. Some federal workers are deemed “essential” and showing up to work. Others have been furloughed during the shutdown. While the Trump administration has found ways, so far, to pay troops and some other employees , a lot of workers are trying to figure out how to live on $0 paychecks. Lawmakers and judges, on the other hand, are receiving their normal salaries because it is written into the Constitution. Some are not accepting the money while the shutdown persists.

There’s some question about whether they’ll ever get paid . A law Trump signed in his first term requires that affected workers get backpay, but Trump’s administration has questioned whether it will apply.

It’s not just federal workers who aren’t getting paid . Contractors who work indirectly for the federal government are also not getting a paycheck. They are not guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends. CNN talked to a woman who has worked as a cleaner at the Smithsonian for nearly 30 years.

Other nongovernmental workers are affected too . The San Diego Union-Tribune talked to criminal defense lawyers who represent indigent clients but aren’t getting paid for their work at the moment.

Nearly 42 million people won’t get their full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits . Judges have ordered the Trump administration to utilize reserve funds, but the SNAP contingency fund isn’t enough to cover the more than $8 billion in benefits that typically go out each month.

Tariffs are partially funding child nutrition programs. A separate food program, WIC, for women, infants and children, is being partially funded by tariff revenue.

Flu, Covid-19 and RSV data aren’t being updated. The lack of data is creating blind spots for local governments and health systems.

Head Start programs are starting to lose funds. Programs that provide early education and child development for low-income children started to lose federal funding on November 1. Funding is staggered to 1,600 different programs across the country throughout the year. Some 140 programs in 41 states have now missed payments, according to CNN’s Tami Luhby .

Obamacare premiums are way up. Democrats triggered the shutdown over their insistence that Republicans negotiate an extension of enhanced subsidies for Obamacare premiums. The premiums are up this year already, even before the end of the enhanced subsidies. Premiums could more than double for some Obamacare enrollees. It remains unclear, as the shutdown drags on, what will happen with the expiration of the enhanced subsidies.

There are travel delays. Air traffic controllers are among the federal workers required to work without pay. As more of them either call in sick or take time to work other jobs, the number of understaffed airports has increased. On Halloween weekend, CNN documented 98 instances of staffing shortages and a total of more than 400 shortages during the shutdown so far.

There are some mortgage delays. Loan approval has continued for most homebuyers, but CNN found some government loan programs have been affected, like a US Department of Agriculture program to encourage purchases in rural and suburban areas. The government-backed flood insurance program also stopped writing new policies.

No new Small Business Administration-guaranteed loans for small businesses. Applications for government-backed loans were frozen on October 1. The agency says it is unable to deliver $170 million to businesses each day. CNN talked to a wine importer who can’t close on a loan but is simultaneously getting hit with a tariff bill.

Nuclear safety workers were furloughed for the first time . The agency that oversees the safety and security of the US nuclear stockpile furloughed most of its 1,400-person workforce, which forced National Nuclear Security Administration sites, including Pantex in Texas and Y-12 in Tennessee, “into safe shutdown mode.”

Read more about the nuclear security furloughs. And also read about Trump’s order for the US to begin testing nuclear weapons for the first time since the ‘90s.

A $7 billion hit to the economy. At least. The first month of the shutdown will ultimately cost the US economy between $7 billion and $14 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The shutdown will actually cause a much larger slowdown in GDP, but most of the loss will ultimately be recouped.

$33 billion in delayed spending… and counting. The government likely delayed $33 billion in the first month of the shutdown, according to CBO. If the shutdown lasts six weeks, the federal government will have delayed spending $54 billion, including $16 billion in compensation that did not go out to federal workers, $36 billion that was not spent on goods and services and $2 billion that won’t be spent on SNAP benefits. If the shutdown lasts eight weeks, the amount of delayed spending jumps to $74 billion, according to CBO .

But we don’t really know how the shutdown is affecting the economy. Jobs, unemployment and retail data aren’t being collected by the government during the shutdown. That makes it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to make informed decisions about whether to lower interest rates.

IRS operations have been limited. But tax law still applies! And the IRS is still pivoting to implement provisions in the recently passed tax and spending cuts bill, what Republicans named the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

National cemeteries are affected. Burials continue, but upkeep and things like headstone placement are being delayed, according to local reports .

Many national parks are open, but not staffed . Volunteers are trying to step in and help, as CNN’s Bill Weir found in Yosemite .

Blue states have been targeted for cuts. Trump administration officials targeted blue states including California and New York by canceling infrastructure projects totaling $8 billion at the beginning of the shutdown.

Furloughed health care workers were recalled to the office . It’s Medicare open enrollment until December 7, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services brought thousands of furloughed workers back to the office to help individuals sign up for health insurance plans.

It’s not possible to get a marriage certificate the normal way in Washington, DC. Most court operations continue, but the District’s superior court has paused issuing marriage licenses and conducting marriage ceremonies. Another DC office has stepped in after the DC Council passed an emergency bill according to the local outlet The 51st.

There have been fewer IPOs. With Securities and Exchange Commission staffers furloughed, it has been more difficult for companies to go public or spin off subsidiaries. The SEC did offer a way for companies to proceed with IPOs during the shutdown, but many companies delayed their IPO plans, according to the Wall Street Journal ."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/trump-power-grabs-gop-democrats-analysis,cnn,The GOP starts to confront what Trump’s power grabs will mean when Democrats are in charge,Aaron Blake,2025-11-06T13:00:01.153Z,"For nine months, congressional Republicans have largely stood idly by as President Donald Trump has gone to great lengths to try to expand the power of the presidency, demolish norms and disregard laws .

But increasingly, the implications of those power grabs are starting to come into focus – and specifically, what they might mean when the shoe is on the other foot the next time Democrats are in charge.

And Republicans seem to be starting to reckon with that.

Perhaps most striking was a scene Wednesday at the Supreme Court, during oral arguments in a challenge to Trump’s worldwide tariffs .

The day prior, a CNBC host had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent whether he worried about a Democratic president abusing the power Trump was claiming. Host Joe Kernen posited that this future president could levy large tariffs on energy based solely on a declaration that there was a climate change emergency. Bessent demurred, saying, “I would question whether there’s a climate emergency.”

But that’s not really the point. The point is that the Trump administration has more or less argued that it wouldn’t matter if there was actually a climate emergency; it says all that really matters is that a president would say there’s one , and that the courts lack the authority to question that.

While Bessent was able to squirm out of this hypothetical on Tuesday, the Trump administration wasn’t so fortunate at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

In fact, three justices – including Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch – pressed the Trump administration’s solicitor general, D. John Sauer, on this exact hypothetical.

Gorsuch asked whether a president could impose a 50% tariff on gas-powered cars and auto parts by simply claiming a climate emergency.

Sauer, like Bessent, cast doubt on whether that declaration would be accurate. But he otherwise acknowledged: “It’s very likely that could be done. Very likely.”

When Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked whether anyone would be able to challenge that declaration, Sauer suggested the bar would be sky-high.

“That would be a situation where at least there’d be a very, very, very deferential judicial review of that kind of determination,” Sauer said. He again emphasized the courts’ review should be “very, very deferential and easily satisfied.”

The exchanges laid bare the potential cost of tariff-skeptical Republicans’ acquiescence to Trump.

Trump is attempting to set a precedent that his own administration says could be wielded by a liberal president in huge ways that Republicans would very much not like.

(Of course, Congress could simply assert its power over tariffs and prevent all that. But that would require actually standing up to Trump.)

Another example in recent days is the burgeoning GOP debate over getting rid of the filibuster.

Trump seems to have settled on the so-called “nuclear option” as his recipe for ending the now-record-breaking federal government shutdown . He wants Republican senators to make it so that legislation only requires a bare majority (which Republicans currently have) rather than the currently required 60 votes.

Trump has long desired this, of course. But the current debate has apparently given him a good opportunity to break down one of his most significant remaining obstacles.

But it’s also led to some rather unusual and pretty firm pushback among Republicans. Their argument: This would be a disaster when Democrats have power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly predicted Democrats would add Democratic senators by making Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia into states. He’s said they would pack the Supreme Court to overturn the current conservative advantage. And he’s said they would restrict gun rights, among other liberal grab-bag policies.

“(The filibuster) holds us back from the Democrats’ worst impulses,” Johnson said this week.

Sens. Roger Marshall of Kansas, Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania have made similar points.

“And listen: Just imagine a world where there’s no filibuster and you have the crazy radical part of the Democratic Party in charge,” McCormick told Fox News over the weekend. “We would become a country of socialism.”

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas offered similar warnings after Trump’s Federal Communications Commission chairman, Brendan Carr, pressured ABC to suspend Jimmy Kimmel over a joke about Trump and Charlie Kirk. Cruz compared it to mob tactics and called it “ dangerous as hell .”

“Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again – wins the White House … they will silence us,” Cruz said. “They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly.”

We even saw a smattering of these kinds of objections to Trump’s extraordinary deployments of the National Guard around the country.

“I worry about someday a Democrat president sending troops or National Guard from New York, California, Oregon, Washington state to North Carolina,” North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told The Hill last month.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt in comments to the New York Times warned his fellow Republicans about the precedent set by a president working with governors of other states to impose National Guard troops on a state where officials didn’t want that.

“We believe in the federalist system — that’s states’ rights,” Stitt said, adding: “Oklahomans would lose their mind if (Gov. JB) Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”

Washington state Republican Party Chairman Jim Walsh has also reportedly raised concerns about future presidents overusing the National Guard.

And Vice President JD Vance last week was pressed on such a hypothetical during a Turning Point USA event. A student told him the Guard deployments were “kind of disturbing me a little bit,” because of how Democrats might use such a precedent against conservatives.

Vance urged the student not to worry about such things.

“It’s an important part of my entire political philosophy – is we cannot be afraid to do something, because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said. “The left is already going to do it, regardless of whether we do it.”

Of course, there is no actual evidence Democrats have prepared to do such things with the National Guard.

Indeed, former President Barack Obama recently wondered aloud what the right would say if he imposed the National Guard on a red state like Texas. “ It is mind-boggling to me how Fox News would have responded ,” Obama said.

And this is also an area in which the administration has basically claimed unchecked presidential power when pressed by judges.

During an appeals-court hearing back in June, a Trump-appointed judge asked top DOJ official Brett Shumate if it was the Trump administration’s position that a president’s decision to call up militias from all 50 states and the District of Columbia was un-reviewable by the courts. Shumate said that it was .

In other words, Obama, under this line of thinking, would indeed have been able to send the Guard into Texas, no questions asked.

These kinds of hypotheticals haven’t caused Republicans to truly move to check Trump’s power, at least not yet. But if anything, the elections this week, in which Democrats won pretty resoundingly , should remind them that the shoe could be on the other foot relatively soon.

Of course, Trump has an answer for that, too. Maybe if he just gets all the power, he’ll make it so Democrats never actually win power again.

“Now, if we do what I’m saying (on the filibuster), they’ll most likely never attain power,” Trump told GOP senators on Wednesday. “Because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine.”

It seems unlikely GOP senators will actually buy into that."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/americas/us-sanctions-colombia-petro-latam-intl,cnn,US sanctions Colombian president,"Max Saltman, Jennifer Hansler, Michael Rios",2025-10-24T19:55:22.955Z,"The US Treasury Department announced on Friday that it is sanctioning Colombian President Gustavo Petro , accusing him of playing a “ role in the global illicit drug trade.” Also sanctioned are Petro’s wife and son, and Colombia’s interior minister.

“Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.

Petro, who has previously rejected such accusations, swiftly responded to the announcement, saying on X that he had retained an American lawyer and intended to fight the sanctions.

“Fighting drug trafficking for decades — and doing so effectively — has brought me this measure from the government of the very society we helped so much to curb its cocaine consumption,” Petro said, referring to the United States. “Quite a paradox, but not one step back, and never on our knees.”

Tensions between Petro’s government and US President Donald Trump have grown for months, especially since the United States began ramping up military activity in the southern Caribbean .

Petro has sharply criticized US military strikes on alleged drug boats in the region, accusing the United States of being “ murderers .” He has suggested that some of the boats carried innocent Colombians.

At least one US strike in the Caribbean over the past two months targeted Colombian nationals on a boat that had sailed from Colombia, two people briefed by the Pentagon told CNN earlier this month. Another strike on a submersible left two survivors, one of whom was Colombian .

Elizabeth Dickinson, the International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Colombia, described the sanctions on Petro as “the personalization of a bilateral crisis.”

On the “day-to-day level and institutional level, there really isn’t a problem between the US and Colombia. Where the problem is this personal crisis, personal conflict,” she told CNN, noting it was not the first time there have been disagreements between Washington and Bogota.

“The Colombian military and security forces have worked hand-in-hand with the United States for close to four decades,” she told CNN. “They are by far the most capable and willing partners that the US has in the region.”

Colombia had long been Washington’s most reliable ally in South America on national security and defense. In 2022, the Biden administration designated the Andean country as a “major non-NATO ally.”

The sanctions were imposed days after Trump said he had halted “all payments” to Colombia, claiming that Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country. The US State Department also revoked Petro’s visa at the conclusion of the UN General Assembly session last month.

CNN has reached out to the Colombian presidency for further comment.

Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti also criticized the sanctions in a post on X, writing that he had “never entered the house of even a single drug trafficker.”

“For the US, a non-violent statement is the same as being a drug trafficker,” Benedetti added. “Gringos go home.”

Petro’s son Nicholas, in a post, called the move “political and judicial persecution without precedent” and said that he will “turn to international organizations to defend my rights.”

The US Treasury Department said Nicolas Petro was arrested in Colombia in 2023 “for money laundering and illicit enrichment over allegations that he funneled money received from drug traffickers into Gustavo Petro’s ‘total peace’ efforts and election campaign.” Nicolas Petro pushed back on this, saying the prosecutor had stated that the case has nothing to do with drug trafficking or the presidential campaign."
https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/politics/trump-shutdown-2025-elections-obamacare-tariffs-scotus-analysis,cnn,An epochal political week opens with shutdown about to break record,Stephen Collinson,2025-11-03T05:00:01.636Z,"A defining week has dawned in American politics with huge implications for Donald Trump’s second presidency, for his fellow Republicans and for a Democratic Party seeking to build a new future from the ashes of its 2024 election humiliation.

The government shutdown is now in its 34th day and less than 48 hours from becoming the longest ever. But none of the political stakes compare to the misery of millions of Americans now struggling to get by on $0 paychecks, or who risk losing health care or vital food assistance.

“It feels as if the government doesn’t care. The holidays are coming — people are going to be hungry. We are the land of opportunity, and it doesn’t look like it,” Janis, a federal worker, who is the daughter and granddaughter of military veterans, told CNN’s Camila DeChalus at a food bank in suburban Maryland .

Trump seems oblivious to political appearances or the risk that the shutdown could further damage him among most Americans who have soured on his second term. Creating an impression of gilded indifference, he hosted a “Great Gatsby”-themed Halloween party at his luxury Florida club and boasted about the swish renovation of a bathroom at the White House.

In a combative interview on CBS’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday, Trump showed no sign of looking for a way out that did not involve a total defeat for Democrats, whom he described as “crazed lunatics.” He said the opposition party would eventually “have to” capitulate and vote to open the government.

The president has complicated GOP calculations by renewing demands for reluctant Senate Republicans to shatter the chamber’s filibuster rule to reopen the government with a simple majority vote. GOP leaders fear this would embolden a future Democratic majority.

“The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We’re not going to lose power,” Trump said on “60 Minutes.”

The nation’s embittered politics, which set the stage for the Washington shutdown disaster, will take a fresh twist with a handful of key elections Tuesday , which could help resolve the impasse. Or perhaps they’ll just deepen the morass.

Voters will deliver the first major verdict on Trump’s second term in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, where Democrats lead in the polls. The New York mayor’s race could enshrine democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani as an electric new talent in a party split between wariness of his politics and enthusiasm over his youth. A victory for Mamdani over the old guard of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo would also hand a new foil to Trump, who paints the 34-year-old as the far-left face of his rival party.

In California, meanwhile, voters will decide whether to redraw the congressional map to favor Democrats in a clutch of seats , in response to Trump’s similar moves in Texas and elsewhere ahead of next year’s midterm elections. Their endorsement would be a huge boost for California Gov. Gavin Newsom , who is claiming a national leadership role ahead of a likely run for president in 2028.

The elections and the deepening pain over the shutdown, set off on October 1 by Senate Democrats in a bid to force Republicans to extend Obamacare subsidies , will play out against the daily backdrop of chaos and extremes of the second Trump era. The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear arguments over Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs that started a global trade war. The justices’ eventual decision could set up a showdown with the executive branch or confirm Trump’s claim of emergency powers in yet another vast expansion of presidential authority.

The same underlying question — of whether Trump is illegally acting on powers he’s not granted by the Constitution — underpins an escalating crisis over the administration’s strikes against what it claims are drug traffickers’ boats in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Critics accuse the administration of carrying out extrajudicial killings and breaking the law by acting without congressional consent. The White House has offered no proof or justification to the American people for its actions, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has banned subordinates from discussing the strikes with Congress without prior approval.

There were new signs Monday that Trump’s approach in his wild second presidency is backfiring. A new CNN/SSRS poll found the president’s approval rating is at 37%, the lowest level of his second term so far. And the country is in a sour mood, which might benefit Democrats if only they could settle on a message that has public appeal. In the poll, 68% of people say things are going badly in the country, while 72% say the economy is in poor shape.

On Capitol Hill, pressure on both parties to end the shutdown is becoming visceral.

The reality of rising health care premiums for those with Affordable Care Act policies struck home with the start of open enrollment Saturday . Premiums were already set to rise significantly because of the costs of care and drugs. But the expiration of subsidies means prices are shooting out of the reach of many policyholders. This is why Democrats sought to use the only leverage they had in Washington — the ability to block most legislation in the Senate — to force a showdown to coerce Republicans into action.

“We want to make sure that we can decisively address the Republican health care crisis, which is crushing people all across the country,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday.

If the dispute was only about health care, Democrats might have claimed victory by now.

But by closing the government, they precipitated the furloughing of millions of federal employees as others were forced to work without pay. This has led to the potential cutoff of food stamps to more than 40 million people and is disrupting air travel as Thanksgiving looms .

Democrats accuse Trump of withholding emergency funding they say could partially finance food stamps for this month, claims that have been validated by several federal judges.

But the extreme disruption and costs of the shutdown are scrambling normal political calculations and may mean no party earns a clear-cut win. “It’s very unfortunate that Donald Trump and Republicans have decided to weaponize hunger and withhold SNAP benefits,” Jeffries told Tapper.

Yet House Speaker Mike Johnson pointed out that the broader deprivation caused by the shutdown would not have occurred had Democrats agreed to GOP demands to reopen the government ahead of talks on Obamacare subsidies.

“I don’t know how they can believe they’re winning, if it were indeed a game to them,” Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.” The Louisiana Republican said Trump was “desperate” to reopen the government and had offered negotiations. The sticking point, however, is the Republican demand for the government to reopen so talks can happen — and the Democrat belief that such offers cannot be trusted.

Trump said on “60 Minutes” that he was ready to fix the Obamacare subsidies problem. “We should fix that. Fix it. And we can fix it with the Democrats,” he said. “All they have to do is let the country open and we’ll fix it.”

But the president, as has been the case across his two terms, did not lay out any detailed plan for making health care more affordable.

Some Democratic and Republican senators have been speaking informally about a device to fund the government in the short term. But Trump’s demands to eradicate the filibuster suggest he’s got no plans to back down. This hints at what is different in this shutdown. The president has proved that he’s ready to impose pain on anyone to fulfill his political goals and that the normal logic of shutdown politics may not apply. While Democratic voters are demanding their party shows backbone against Trump, their leaders must work out a way to create an off-ramp that would allow them to claim victory.

Warning signs are also mounting for Trump and Republicans. New polls show that the Democrats’ top demand — extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies — is popular. And in a Washington Post-ABC News poll Thursday, voters blamed Trump and the GOP more than Democrats for the shutdown by 45%-33%. The president’s approval rating is only 41% in the CNN Poll of Polls average.

But public disdain for Democrats is complicating the party’s effort to exploit Trump’s troubles. Some 68% of people in the Post poll thought the party was out of touch with most Americans. And a CBS News poll found 56% disapproved of Trump’s handling of the shutdown, while 55% said the same of how congressional Democrats and Republicans are responding to the situation.

One warning sign for Democrats is that they are being effectively forced by Trump’s hardline tactics to balance the pain of citizens who risk losing health care against the suffering of those who could lose nutrition benefits.

Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman wants to reopen the government so health care and food assistance crises can be addressed. “I fully, fully support these things, but this is the wrong tactic,” Fetterman said on “State of the Union.”

“And right now, by doing this, our government shut down, we’re getting neither of those things, and they guarantee neither you’re going to get your SNAP benefits, and you’re not going to get those kind of tax credits that we all need,” Fetterman continued. “Reopen this thing, and we can find a way forward.”

One intriguing question this week would be whether a Democratic sweep in New Jersey, Virginia, New York and the California redistricting initiative would reshape Republican shutdown tactics. Republicans might panic only a year ahead of the midterm elections.

But Johnson, who will lose his job as speaker if Democrats win back the House next year, insisted on Sunday that the impasse could end because the opposition party would no longer need to use it as an issue as voters make their decisions. “We do have a sense that something may change next week,” he told the Republican Jewish Coalition leadership summit during a virtual appearance Saturday.

But a rank-and-file Republican warned Sunday his party must make health care more affordable once the government is reopened. “The midterms are going to be a whole lot harder if Republicans just sit there and say, ‘We’re just going to let it (the enhanced subsidies) lapse. We’re not going to do anything,’” Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”

The cost of living has shaped campaigning ahead of Tuesday’s elections, along with Trump’s perceived excesses. “Virginia voters can and will send a message amid the recklessness and the heartlessness out of Washington,” Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Saturday.

Democrats in New Jersey branded GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli as a tool of Trump. But outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is also unpopular, and Ciattarelli called for change in a state that has sometimes chosen GOP governors.

Former President Barack Obama on Saturday campaigned in both states, confirming his status as one of the few A-list national Democrats — but also the party’s desperate need to find new voices.

He told voters in Norfolk, Virginia, that the stakes were clear. “We don’t need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. We don’t need to wonder about whether vulnerable people are going to be hurt, or ask ourselves how much more coarse and mean our culture can become. We’ve witnessed it. Elections do matter,” he said.

https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-argentina-bailout-beef-rcna238720,msnbc,"As Trump’s Argentina bailout gets worse, so do his excuses",Ja'han Jones,2025-10-20T21:42:59.000Z,"As millions of Americans suffer from the effects of his destructive tariff war, and as others suffer from furloughs amid the ongoing government shutdown, the president of the United States on Sunday issued a passionate defense of the people.

The people of Argentina, that is.

The president gave a snappy response to a reporter when he was asked how he justifies showering aid on the South American nation as American farmers suffer the consequences of his tariff war.

The Trump administration recently announced $40 billion in aid to Argentina that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said is intended to prop up the faltering economy of Argentina’s Trump-aligned President Javier Milei, who has relied on some of the same principles that Republicans have implemented stateside. Trump’s irked response came after he floated the possibility of purchasing beef from Argentina, framing it as a plan to help American consumers dealing with higher grocery prices.

A reporter asked the president about American farmers who have been outraged that his bailouts in Argentina could undercut them. “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting Argentina more than it is them...” the reporter started to ask before Trump interrupted. The president — whose administration has appeared to leap at the opportunity to cut programs Americans depend on during a shutdown predicated on his party’s refusal to negotiate on health insurance subsidies — responded with some thinly veiled sexism and a claim that his plan is about improving the lives of poor and downtrodden Argentines:

‘Look, look, Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You know what that means? They’re fighting for their life. Nothing’s benefiting Argentina. They’re fighting for their life. You understand what that means? They have no money, they have no anything, they’re fighting so hard to survive. If I can help them survive in a free world — I happen to like the president of Argentina, I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They are dying.’

Let’s also note that Trump and the Republican Party slashed billions of dollars in foreign aid to countries around the world this year, an act that human rights experts said could result in millions of deaths . So it’s fair to question whether Trump’s concern for the health and well-being of people abroad, or just his alliance with Milei, is his priority. Not to mention that numerous hedge fund executives and associates of Bessent — who has been overseeing the aid to Argentina — stand to benefit greatly from Trump’s taxpayer-funded generosity.

Indeed, there seem to be a bunch of less-than-charitable reasons that Trump and his team want to shovel billions of Americans’ tax dollars to his right-wing cronies. And none of them square with the president’s promise to put “America First.”"
https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/mike-johnson-government-shutdown-polls-republicans-democrats-rcna238917,msnbc,Republicans are losing the political battle over the shutdown,Joe Scarborough,2025-10-21T20:17:55.000Z,"This is an adapted excerpt from the Oct. 21 episode of “Morning Joe.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson has continued to defend his decision not to swear in Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. On Monday, the Republican told reporters on Capitol Hill that he was “willing and anxious” to swear in Grijalva, but said he was unable to do so due to the ongoing government shutdown.

“In the meantime,” Johnson continued , “instead of doing TikTok videos, she should be serving her constituents. She could be taking their calls, she could be directing them, trying to help them through the crisis that the Democrats have created by shutting down the government.”

I didn’t think it was possible, but the speaker’s statements are getting more ridiculous by the day. Whatever his reasoning is for delaying Grijalva’s swearing-in, it’s the people of Arizona’s 7th Congressional District who are paying the price.

She can’t answer calls. She doesn’t even have a congressional office. She isn’t able to help her constituents because they aren’t officially her constituents yet — and they aren’t her constituents yet because Johnson keeps refusing to swear her in.

This is just one of the reasons why Republicans are losing the political battle right now. It’s not like I haven’t been saying that from the beginning; we all knew Donald Trump and his party were going to pay a price for this ridiculous shutdown.

The truth is, Republicans almost always get blamed for government shutdowns. I was a Republican lawmaker during a government shutdown. That time around, we did the right thing but we still got blamed. We ended up balancing the budget, but it didn’t matter.

However, in this case, Republicans aren’t doing the right thing. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers and members of the U.S. military are working every day without pay, all while members of Congress sit at home. During my time in the House, we would have been back on the Hill, holding press conferences to force our speaker to bring us back into session and fix this.

The American people know Republicans are the ones who have the power to stop this shutdown. They know Johnson could pass a bill today that would allow our men and women in uniform to be paid , to make sure our country’s air traffic controllers are paid, and give the hundreds of thousands of other essential federal workers the paychecks they deserve.

According to an Ipsos/Reuters poll , 72% of Americans are in favor of extending Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies. That means that 72% of Americans are on the side of the Democrats and disagree with Republicans on the central issue that is shaping this government shutdown.

Another poll from AP-NORC found that only 30% of Americans believe the country is going in the right direction, while 69% believe it’s going in the wrong direction. That’s bad news for Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House.

It’s been a long time since Democrats have been on the right side of any political fight when you look at the polls, but this is one of those times."
https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-influencers-slavery-maga-rcna238690,msnbc,These far-right influencers are all-in on chattel slavery,Ja'han Jones,2025-10-21T03:02:02.000Z,"A strain of explicit pro-slavery sentiment is coursing through the outer extremes of the MAGA movement. Operatives and influencers aligned with the movement — which has made the treasonous Confederacy into a cause célèbre and sought to keep the history about the brutality of chattel slavery out of public view — have been documented in recent weeks offering wholehearted defenses, if not outright support, for the idea of owning other human beings.

Joshua Haymes — a far-right podcast host and former pastor at Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s church who argued that the fall of the pro-slavery Confederacy inflicted longterm damage to the nation — went on a rant last week saying “the institution of slavery is not inherently evil,” that it’s “not inherently evil to own a human being,” and that “every Christian in today’s society should be able to defend” those claims, Right Wing Watch noted . Haymes said it was “chronological snobbery” to condemn the United States’ slave-owning founders, who “could in fact treat their slaves the way the Bible tells them to treat their slaves,” and that although he condemns slaveowners who “actually engaged in real abuse,” Christians “cannot condemn the entire institution of slavery outright.”

For the record, all slaveowners engaged in “real abuse” because claiming ownership over another human is inherently abusive. Beyond that, a great many slaveowners literally raped , beat or killed the people they enslaved.

Right Wing Watch documented similarly disturbing pro-slavery apologism from another far-right pastor and pro-MAGA podcaster, Joel Webbon, who said in a recent podcast that today’s Black people would be “living in a grass hut” if not for the white people who held their ancestors in bondage. “The greatest moment in history for any brown or black country is the moment that the White man’s ships arrive on your shore,” he claimed.

GOP operative Peter Giunta reportedly endorsed a conservative group he said supports “slavery and all that s---. Mega based,” according to Politico’s reporting on a vile, Republican-run group chat. (Giunta told Politico that “I am so sorry to those offended by the insensitive and inexcusable language” but suggested the texts “may have been deceptively doctored.”) Giunta was dismissed from his chief of staff position with New York Assemblymember Mike Reilly on Friday.

And in at least one example, the MAGA movement’s fascination with slavery appears to be not merely about re-litigating the past, but setting a path for the future. Earlier this month, Media Matters captured pro-Trump streamer Zack Hoyt, who goes by the name “Asmongold” online, saying federal agents enacting Trump’s anti-immigrant crackdown shouldn’t harm protesters, “only because I would want to utilize their bodies for compelled slave labor.”

“That’s the only reason,” said Hoyt, who has vocally supported Trump’s authoritarian mass incarceration plans.

All of this is important context for Americans to consider the next time they see Confederate flags waving at a Trump rally, or the next time you hear the Trump administration tout its efforts to lionize confederate generals."
https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kennedy-shutdown-congress-pay-bills-rcna242368,msnbc,A Republican senator has a new idea to end the shutdown. It’s bad.,"Ryan Teague Beckwith,Newsletter Editor, Ryan Teague Beckwith",2025-11-07T11:00:41.000Z,"Congress isn’t working. The House of Representatives hasn’t held a vote since Sept. 19 , Speaker Mike Johnson won’t even swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona and the Senate mostly keeps voting on the same failed Republican spending bill . The federal government shutdown, now the longest in history , is forcing air traffic controllers to work second shifts delivering food on DoorDash to make ends meet.

But members of Congress are still getting paid.

It’s tempting to rail against that disparity, to lambaste members of the do-nothing Congress picking up a sweet $174,000 a year (even more if they're in leadership) — not to mention their fancy health care and retirement packages — even as their own staff and other civil servants have to work without pay until the shutdown ends. Why should lawmakers get paid when the government is shut down?

But as H.L. Mencken wrote , “there is always a well-known solution to every human problem — neat, plausible, and wrong.”

As if on cue, Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana has come forward with that kind of plan — one that, to be fair, has been floated by Democrats during past shutdowns. On Thursday, Kennedy introduced two bills: legislation that would either force members of Congress to forfeit their pay during a shutdown or put lawmakers’ compensation in escrow to be paid out when the shutdown ends.

“What’s good for the goose is good for the gander,” he said Wednesday.

Despite his folksy mannerisms, Kennedy is an Oxford law graduate, which means he should know the most obvious objection to this scheme. The 27th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1992, bars changes in compensation for members of Congress from taking effect until after the next House election, which in this case would be 2026. The amendment was designed to stop lawmakers from giving themselves an immediate raise, but it also prevents them from taking an immediate pay cut, too. So even if Kennedy’s legislation were passed, it probably would not have an effect on this shutdown.

In a floor speech introducing the bill, Kennedy said he didn’t think his first bill — which would forfeit lawmaker pay entirely — violates the Constitution, but he was proposing the second bill as an option for members who do see a clash. It’s an open question whether withholding pay until the end of a shutdown would violate the 27th Amendment. But another part of the Constitution is unambiguous: Article I, Section 6, which says members of Congress “shall” be paid.

Assuming the second bill passes muster, there is another good reason why withholding pay from members of Congress is a bad idea.

Docking their pay is not actually going to hit many of them where it hurts. Kennedy, for example, has a net worth of $20 million, according to a Quiver Quantitative estimate of his stock holdings based on annual financial disclosure forms. Skipping a couple of paychecks is not going to cause Kennedy financial distress. A few missed direct deposits wouldn’t hurt most of his colleagues either. A 2020 study by Open Secrets estimated that more than half of members of Congress are millionaires.

The only ones feeling the sting will be first-term back-bench representatives who’re still paying off their college loans.

But that doesn’t mean that every lawmaker can afford it.

So while it might feel nice to imagine wealthy lawmakers not getting paid like everyone else who is missing out, the reality is the only ones feeling the sting will be first-term back-bench representatives who are still paying off their college loans. Withholding pay would just empower the millionaires in Congress to make similar demands in the future at the expense of their colleagues who need that check this month.

This is not an idle concern. When he was elected, George Washington initially declined the $25,000 salary, but he ultimately changed his mind to avoid setting a precedent that only the wealthy could serve as president. In his final State of the Union address, Washington even called for better pay for federal officials, noting that poor compensation would limit potential candidates with “ talents and virtue unless accompanied by wealth.”

This government shutdown has dragged on too long. It’s hurting civil servants and federal contractors and the broader economy. Kennedy could help end it now by working to compromise with Democrats on extending health care subsidies — not by threatening the financial health of the handful of lawmakers who aren’t millionaires like him.

https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/democrats-new-shutdown-strategy-unity-rcna242498,msnbc,Democrats try a new shutdown strategy: Unity,"Kevin Frey, Mychael Schnell, Ali Vitali, Syedah Asghar, Peggy Helman",2025-11-07T01:56:04.197Z,"After weeks of different Democrats taking different shutdown approaches — some voting with Republicans, some talking with GOP lawmakers about a bipartisan deal and some holding out completely — Democrats emerged from an hourslong closed-door meeting on Thursday advocating a new strategy: unity.

What that unity means, in practice, is unclear. And whether that unity can be maintained — and for how long — remains to be seen. But the answers to those questions could decide how and when the shutdown ends.

“Our goal is to try to all stay together as much as we can,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said as Democrats met.

Asked what the next steps are, however, Murphy reported that he didn’t have “much more to say.”

Across the ideological spectrum, Democrats struck the same tone over and over again: unified in message, vague on mechanics.

“We’re unified on how we’re moving forward,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., told reporters .

“It was an encouraging caucus, because there’s a great deal of unity,” Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said.

“I feel like we’re very unified,” Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., told reporters . “I’m excited to see what we can put together here.”

Behind closed doors, Democrats have been discussing making their own “unified” offer on the shutdown, sources told MSNBC, though they seem to be holding out at the moment to see if Republicans will make a better offer first.

Among the ideas Democrats are discussing is a clean continuing resolution in exchange for a guaranteed vote on scaled-down Obamacare subsidies — by a date certain and in the House and Senate — though sources cautioned that nothing is set in stone.

At the moment, Republicans are intent on offering just a slight variation on what they’ve offered Democrats more than a dozen times before. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., plans to hold another vote on government funding on Friday — only this time, it won’t be the same bill that Democrats have already rejected 14 times.

Instead, Thune will offer to amend the bill, attaching a package of three appropriation bills and changing the end date for the stopgap spending measure, three sources told MSNBC. The new funding bill will likely be adjusted from Nov. 21 to some date in January, the sources said, though that detail remains undecided.

The offer resembles a deal that a bipartisan group of members had been working toward for weeks as a possible offramp to the record-breaking shutdown.

But as of Thursday evening, several Senate Democrats told MSNBC that Thune’s latest proposal would not sway them, with many pointing to the lack of action on extending Obamacare subsidies as their reason for their opposition.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said that if the proposal doesn’t address expiring subsidies — and all indications are that it won’t — it’s “a nonstarter for me.”

“I’m not here for show votes,” Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said. “Show votes is not gonna make things an easier situation for a family that has to figure out: I’m gonna pay utility bills, or I’m gonna pay my premiums.”

For all the talk of unity, whether all Democrats will stand in opposition to the bill — considering the growing pain of the shutdown and the fact that many of them were working toward a deal like this for weeks — is unclear. Several Democrats were noncommittal when asked by reporters Thursday night.

“The views of the caucus as a whole are still in flux,” Blumenthal said of the overall dynamics.

I’m totally disgusted with everybody in the Senate right now. I wouldn’t let us manage a ham sandwich, OK? This is embarrassing.”

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.

One Senate Democrat, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive deliberations, said “a nucleus” of the caucus is in agreement that “there has to be a health care guarantee” tied to a funding bill.

“It can’t be a separate vote,” this Democrat said. “It has to be combined.”

That position continues to be a nonstarter for Republicans. Thune and Republicans refuse to negotiate over the Obamacare subsidies while the government is shut down, insisting that Democrats first turn the lights back on before engaging in such deliberations.

At most, Thune has offered to commit to a separate, standalone vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies — with no guarantee it will pass.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., threw an additional wrench into that approach on Thursday, when, in response to a question from MSNBC, he refused to commit to holding a vote on the Obamacare tax credits, calling into question whether the subsidies will ever be extended.

“The House did its job on Sept. 19. I’m not promising anybody anything,” Johnson said. “I’m gonna let this process play out.”

In the Democratic Caucus, some senators privately worry that more moderate members of their group may become antsy and support the GOP offer.

“Everybody wants to do it,” the Senate Democrat said of extending the Obamacare subsidies. “The question is how long another group might be willing or unwilling to hold out.”

This lawmaker added that the Democrats most uncomfortable with the shutdown think that Congress needs to resolve the standoff “in the next couple of weeks” — “before Thanksgiving and better sooner than later.”

But Democrats who are hoping for a better deal are encouraged by some cracks on the GOP side. For one, on Thursday, Republicans began adding sweeteners to their funding offers — like reinstating government workers who have recently been laid off.

For another, there are some Republicans who seem to want to discuss the Obamacare subsidies. Democratic Sens. Kim and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware are scheduled to meet with Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey on Friday to discuss a bipartisan extension of the Obamacare subsidies, two sources confirmed to MSNBC, a cross-party conversation that could bear some fruit.

Still, even if lawmakers started moving on a resolution, it would take a good deal of time to work through the legislative process.

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., predicted that Congress is “at least seven days, and more likely 10, and very possibly two weeks away from opening up — at the best.”

“I’m totally disgusted with everybody in the Senate right now,” Kennedy said. “I wouldn’t let us manage a ham sandwich, OK? This is embarrassing.”

Donald Trump and Republicans are lying to the public left and right — but there are some lies that you just can’t get away with.

The president has shown a remarkable ability over the years to convince large swaths of the American public of all sorts of things that aren’t true, but there are topics Trump’s lies just aren’t sticking. No matter how much Trump tries, his spin is no match for reality when it starts to hit Americans at home. People can tell if their groceries are getting more expensive.

According to a new poll from The Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos, 71% of Americans say groceries are more expensive now than they were a year ago. The same poll found 59% of Americans blame the president “a great deal” or “a good amount” for the current rate of inflation and rising prices.

According to a new poll, 71% of Americans say groceries are more expensive now than they were a year ago.

That’s an important thing to remember as we think about what we saw in elections all across the country this week.

Now, don’t get me wrong — there are a million reasons why Democrats won so many races on Tuesday. But, according to Trump, there was one major reason behind the Democrats’ success and the Republicans’ failure: the ongoing government shutdown .

On Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Republican senators, the president told reporters : “I thought we’d have a discussion after the press leaves about what last night represented and what we should do about it. And also about the shutdown and how that relates to last night. If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor — negative for the Republicans.”

Trump’s right. Poll after poll has shown that the American public blames Republicans for the government shutdown. That is because the shutdown is not some big abstract political thing happening in D.C.; it is affecting Americans’ lives in real, tangible ways that Republicans can’t spin their way out of.

On Tuesday, despite court orders from two different federal judges requiring the Trump administration to fund SNAP , the food stamp program that nearly 42 million Americans rely on, the president claimed he would refuse to release any funding until Democrats caved and ended the shutdown .

The president is choosing to make this as painful as possible.

The White House has since walked back that claim, but food is still not on Americans’ tables. Although the Trump administration said it will partially fund SNAP benefits this month, millions of Americans still may not actually see that aid any time soon, because the guidance the U.S. Department of Agriculture has given for distributing those partial benefits is filled with red tape that could mean it will take weeks before anyone can actually access those funds.

Just like the Trump administration’s decision not to fund SNAP in the first place, none of that is necessary. The president is choosing to make this as painful as possible.

On Wednesday, a USDA official told a federal court that once those funds are eventually distributed, SNAP recipients will receive only 65% of what they are entitled to.

The average SNAP allowance is $187 per person a month. Trump wants to make that just $121.55.

Can you imagine trying to buy a month’s worth of groceries with $121.55?

However, on Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to fully fund SNAP benefits for November by Friday — halting the president’s cuts, for now.

But that is the reality the Trump administration wants to force upon millions of Americans — and that is a reality that no amount of lies can spin."
https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-snap-benefits-right-wing-populism-rcna242151,msnbc,Trump is blatantly using hunger as a political weapon,"Zeeshan Aleem,MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor, Zeeshan Aleem",2025-11-05T23:33:08.669Z,"As the government shutdown drags on, the food insecurity of roughly 40 million Americans is being used as a political bargaining chip — and emerging as an appalling example of right-wing “populism.”

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, colloquially known as food stamps, has been in the news for days as funding for the program expired and the deadline for benefits to be paid out loomed.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that “millions of low-income Americans will see staggering cuts and delays to their food stamps this month — with some receiving potentially nothing at all — because of the way that the White House has chosen to pay partial benefits during the government shutdown.”

Now it looks like the way in which SNAP benefits will be disbursed will make it harder for people to access the aid they should be getting.

Initially, the Trump administration took the position that it would not pay anything at all. In mid-October, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters that the shutdown meant the program  was going to “run out of money” at the end of the month. The Trump administration, attempting to win a political battle with Democrats over the federal shutdown, said it could not pay any benefits for November. But SNAP has a contingency fund of about $6 billion, more than $5 billion of which could be used toward SNAP benefits . That sum would cover a good chunk of the roughly $8 billion in November payments.

Last week, two federal judges ruled that Trump could not legally suspend SNAP payments. They determined that the administration had incorrectly argued that it was legally barred from accessing the contingency fund — and that the administration was required to pay at least partial benefits by tapping into the fund.

Yet Trump has dragged his feet. After the court rulings came down, the president, who has made novel claims this year to executive powers, said he needed more clarity. He posted on Truth Social: “Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do.” Then on Tuesday, he threatened to buck the courts, saying all SNAP benefits “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!” His administration has since walked back that position, saying it was working on sending out the partial funds in accordance with court orders.

But now it looks like the way in which SNAP benefits will be disbursed will make it harder for people to access the aid they should be getting. According to the Times:

By Tuesday, officials at the Agriculture Department issued more intricate guidance, which appeared to suggest some families could lose SNAP benefits entirely. The agency essentially required states to recalculate benefits for SNAP beneficiaries, using a new rubric to determine payment amounts. The extent of those changes alarmed anti-hunger groups and angered state officials, some of whom described the revisions as unnecessary, punitive and burdensome at a perilous time for many poor families.

Analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities cited by the Times calculates that the new shutdown policy could cut benefits by 61% — a bigger cut to benefits than what the Trump administration estimated in court based on the contingency fund. In other words, the Trump administration may be using bureaucratic hurdles to minimize the benefits it must provide from its contingency fund. Furthermore, it’s unclear when the payments will be going out — an uncertainty that could be an additional source of distress for people who rely on them.

This is all pretty appalling. As Trump throws ostentatious Gatsby-themed parties and posts photos of his refurbishment of the White House , he’s playing politics with the hunger of roughly 40 million Americans. And he’s doing it because he and his party refuse to accede or even negotiate on Democrats’ demands to extend Obamacare subsidies to keep health insurance affordable for millions of Americans. It only underscores how much his agenda is hostile to the working class and poor.

https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/democrats-won-big-election-night-shutdown-rcna242224,msnbc,Democrats won big on election night. Now they’re wondering if they can win the shutdown,Kevin Frey,2025-11-06T01:11:58.349Z,"A day after Democrats swept a series of off-year elections on Tuesday, Democratic senators returned to the Capitol with a complicated choice: whether to use the election as renewed leverage and hold firm on the shutdown, or take a bipartisan deal that would reopen government but do little to actually address skyrocketing Obamacare premiums.

For now, different groups of Democrats seem to have different approaches.

For the moderate wing of the Senate’s Democratic Caucus, which has been working toward a deal with Republicans to end the shutdown, Tuesday’s decisive election results didn’t seem to do much.

Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., told MSNBC on Wednesday that conversations about the shutdown will “continue until we resolve this.”

“It’s not going to stop,” Peters said.

Another member of that bipartisan group, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said Wednesday that the talks remain “positive.”

And Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., told MSNBC that “as long as we’re talking and negotiating, still trying to move forward, that’s going to be helpful.”

But for the Democrats who were already frustrated with the deal that was emerging , the election results only stiffened their resolve. The voters, they said, had sent a message: Hold firm .

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told reporters on Wednesday that “It would be very strange if, on the heels of the American people having rewarded Democrats for standing up and fighting, we surrendered without getting anything for the people we were fighting for.”

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., echoed Murphy, saying the election results “should embolden us to know the American people are on our side,” adding that he hopes his colleagues read the results that same way.

Other Democrats cited Trump’s growing unease with the shutdown as a reason to hold firm.

“Donald Trump finally realizes that he’s got a problem on his hands,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., told reporters Wednesday. “He clearly saw it as a liability in the elections last night, so he should come to the table and help fix it.”

In a post on social media Tuesday night , as the votes were being counted, Trump listed the shutdown as one of “two reasons that Republicans lost elections.” (The other reason was that “TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT.”)

The next morning, the president told Senate Republicans at a White House breakfast meeting that the shutdown had been “worse for us than for them,” according to several senators in attendance, pressuring Republicans to nix the 60-vote filibuster . Ditching the filibuster would allow GOP lawmakers to open the government unilaterally without needing Democratic support.

Even before the election, public polling had routinely shown Democrats to be in the driver seat politically on the shutdown, with Americans routinely blaming Republicans more than Democrats for the standoff.

But with the pain of the shutdown mounting, many Democrats are still looking for a speedy resolution, even if it means Democrats come away with less than they wanted on their demands to address rising Obamacare premiums.

Just 24 hours earlier, a potential deal appeared to be in view , with Senate sources telling MSNBC that negotiators were eyeing a plan where lawmakers would advance a so-called “mini-bus” of three appropriations bills alongside a short-term funding bill to reopen the rest of government.

But a vote on the central Democratic demand of the shutdown — extending the expiring Obamacare subsidies — would come separately, with no guarantee of passage.

The contours of that fragile agreement were leaked before polls closed on Tuesday, when Democrats came away with convincing wins — including double-digit victories in both the Virginia and New Jersey governor races. And Democrats seemed to hope those wins would change the dynamics for Republicans.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters he was “hoping that the results last night incentivize” Trump’s “engagement in a way he hadn’t thought necessary until now.”

Despite that optimism, getting Trump to the table remains no sure bet.

On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., sent a letter to Trump again demanding a meeting.

And just hours later, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Trump had told him he was willing to sit down with the two Democrats — but only after Democrats had voted to reopen the government .

With words printed in golden ink and in a font akin to the “Eat Pray Love” signs adored by moms nationwide, three sheets of paper announce what lies behind the nearby glass door: “The Oval Office.”

His hyperfocus on a vision of 24-karat luxury is increasingly disconnected from reality.

Trump’s sense of style was questionable long before the “all gold everything” decor of his second term. His single-minded determination to place his own visual stamp on the seat of executive power is a continuation of his decades as a realtor obsessed with imagery, often inserting himself into the most minute details of his properties’ designs. But this approach raises far deeper concerns.

Trump has attempted to bring that level of autocratic control to the presidency in matters of both staggering consequence and utter banality. His hyperfocus on a vision of 24-karat luxury is increasingly disconnected from reality as his policies, coupled with the longest federal shutdown in history, leave millions of Americans facing food insecurity and rising prices.

The transformation began quickly after Trump’s second inauguration. Within weeks, an endless string of golden knick-knacks were strewn about the Oval Office; their numbers have only multiplied since then. The Rose Garden was paved over in favor of “the Rose Garden Club,” a facsimile of the patio at his Mar-a-Largo country club. After claiming that the East Wing would remain untouched, Trump greenlit its destruction last month to make room for a massive golden ballroom with an estimated $300 million price tag.

Later that evening, Trump attended a “Great Gatsby”-themed Halloween party at his Mar-a-Lago club, with attendees merrily cosplaying pre-Depression decadence while food bank lines overflowed.

Trump’s maximalist design preferences are the stuff of legend. His penthouse apartment in Trump Tower is a rococo calamity with gold as far as the eye can see. When he purchased Mar-a-Lago in 1986, the mansion was already considered, in the words of the Chicago Tribune , a “monument to Roaring ’20s ostentation.” His love of gold and marble was at least partially influenced by his first wife, Ivanka, who served as his chief interior designer in the 1980s. The then-power couple were intimately involved in the minutia of his then-expanding portfolio. A 1984 feature in The New York Times , published as Trump prepared to open the first of his doomed Atlantic City casinos , said the two made “thousands of decisions, from picking all the wallpapers, curtain backings and braid for the doormen’s uniforms to menus and doorknobs.”

The decades have not lessened that trend, even as more urgent matters should draw his attention. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that Trump flew in his “gold guy,” who worked on Mar-a-Lago, to add the gold molding that now encircles the Oval Office. And based on renderings he’s showed to journalists, we can only assume that the planned White House ballroom will be afforded similar treatment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters last month that her boss’ “heart and his mind is always churning about how to improve things here on the White House grounds. But at this moment in time, of course, the ballroom is really the president’s main priority.”

The president’s aurum-plated predilections have long been a punchline for others. In 1990, the Baltimore Sun reported that a new line of hotels in the region would provide “luxury of a very different type than the Donald Trump model.” The chain will “offer luxury by inference,” the hotel’s general manager said. “It is achieved through attention to total comfort, rather than by gold fixtures and lots of fake marble in the bathrooms.”

It’s becoming harder to maintain that fiction, though, as low-income Americans get particularly pummeled by Trump’s policies.

That hasn’t stopped Trump from peddling his vision of luxury to the masses. When asked how he was moving the wildly expensive condos at Trump Tower in 1984, he simply told the Times: “You sell them a fantasy.” It’s a mantra that was regurgitated in his (ghostwritten) “Art of the Deal” and in his second act as a pop culture phenomenon when hosting “The Apprentice.” Through all his ventures, including the presidency itself, Trump has attempted to sell would-be supporters on the dream that they could be just as rich as him if they only followed his lead. As Northwestern marketing professor Tim Calkins told The Washington Post shortly after the 2016 election that Trump “capitalized on the power of the Trump brand, which people associate with and aspire to luxury, wealth and celebrity.”

It’s becoming harder to maintain that fiction, though, as low-income Americans get particularly pummeled by Trump’s policies. While these voters supported Trump in both his GOP primary bid and general election victory last year, they’ve gotten the short end of the stick since then while the wealthy have prospered. As the shutdown has continued, he’s heaped blame on Democrats while doing little to reassure his supporters who against all evidence to the contrary hoped that he wouldn’t slash their federal benefits.

The divide between Trump’s fantasy and economic reality is already beginning to show up in polling. Last month, a poll from The Economist/YouGov found that only 35% of Americans making less than $50,000 a year approved of his job performance while 59% disapproved. That’s a marked shift from their September survey , in which he had a 40% approval rate among that demographic and a 55% disapproval rate. Similarly, a more recent poll from CNN/SSRS released Monday found 69% of low earners disapproving of Trump’s performance with only 31% lauding his work.

As of Thursday morning, the White House has given no indication whether the signage outside the Oval Office will be permanent — but given the new “Presidential Wall of Fame” that Trump has installed just a few steps away with similar lettering , the odds seem good. The reshaping of the building in his own image serves as a gold-leafed reflection of his desire to alter the country to suit his own selfish whims. But while the tacky signage and metallic gleam may be easily removed, the pain that the countries needy are currently feeling as the president dithers over marble tiling will be much harder to heal.

On Tuesday, voters in California overwhelmingly approved a measure that allows the state’s legislature to redraw its congressional districts, flipping up to five seats to Democrats in next year’s midterm election.

We are in a gerrymandering arms race, and there is no mystery as to why.

It’s known as Proposition 50 and was championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom as a response to the new Texas congressional maps that Republicans drew up at Donald Trump’s request, which could take up to five seats away from Democrats in next year’s midterms.

On Wednesday, California Republicans sued to stop the state from moving forward with redistricting and claimed the new map is unfair — even as their party seeks to gerrymander other red states.

It appears Republicans are pretty much committed to picking their voters, rather than letting the voters pick them. This year, four Republican-controlled states have already redrawn their maps at Trump’s request: Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. The new maps would flip nine seats to Republicans — at least in theory.

But nobody is talking about stopping there. Republicans in Indiana, Nebraska and Florida are all at least exploring redder congressional maps at Trump’s behest. And several Democratic-controlled states are talking about responding in kind.

We are in a gerrymandering arms race , and there is no mystery as to why. After Tuesday’s drubbing, House Speaker Mike Johnson made it clear that redistricting is how Republicans think they will win.

“I think the midterm is gonna be a great one for us,” Johnson told reporters on Wednesday. “We had a demographic shift in 2024. We have a very favorable election map on the Republican side, and it will be even more favorable once all the redistricting stuff has settled out.”

Political scientists even have a word for the phenomenon: “dummymandering.”

But based on what we saw at the polls, I’m not so sure redistricting alone is going to be enough for Republicans. If you are pulling supporters from a deep-red district to make another district red, you end up with two less-red districts. You also can’t guarantee that your red voters from the last election will turn out for you again.

That means the Republicans’ plan could backfire. If voters are angry enough at them, as they were on Tuesday, Republicans could lose both those “red” districts. Political scientists even have a word for the phenomenon: “dummymandering.”

Dumb or not, this is how Republicans think they’ll win. But as Newsom said on Tuesday, they will be opposed.

The California governor had a message for his fellow blue state governors: “We need the state of Virginia. We need the state of Maryland. We need our friends in New York and Illinois and Colorado. We need to see other states, the remarkable leaders that have been doing remarkable things, meet this moment head-on as well.”"
https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/gender-passports-supreme-court-sex-birth-trump-rcna236029,msnbc,Supreme Court majority lets Trump administration enforce new gender policy for passports,Jordan Rubin,2025-11-06T20:33:12.000Z,"The Supreme Court ’s Republican-appointed majority has agreed to let the Trump administration implement its new passport policy, which has been opposed by a group of transgender and nonbinary Americans.

“Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth — in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,” the majority wrote Thursday .

The latest ruling in favor of the Trump administration came over dissent from the court’s three Democratic appointees. “The documented real-world harms to these plaintiffs obviously outweigh the Government’s unexplained (and inexplicable) interest in immediate implementation of the Passport Policy,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in dissent, joined Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. She said the majority “has once again paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate (or, really, any ) justification.”

Under previous government policy, transgender passport applicants could choose male or female to correspond to their gender identity or sex assigned at birth, and intersex, nonbinary and gender nonconforming applicants could choose “X” instead of male or female. The new policy restricts passport applicants to their sex assigned at birth and to male or female, following President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”

U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick issued an injunction against the new policy in June. The Biden appointee in Massachusetts wrote that the plaintiffs showed “uncontroverted evidence of the harms that transgender and non-binary people face if they are required to use passports bearing sex designations aligning with their sex assigned at birth rather than their gender identity.” The judge wrote that “transgender people with gender-discordant identity documents have an elevated risk of encountering problems with airport security and experiencing harassment or violence when traveling, particularly to countries that criminalize transgender expression.”

An appellate panel rejected the administration ’ s request to lift Kobick’s order. The panel of Biden appointees reasoned that the plaintiffs “will suffer a variety of immediate and irreparable harms” if the policy is enforced.

U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer took an urgent appeal to the Supreme Court, seeking to lift the injunction while the litigation proceeds. He wrote that there’s “no basis in law or logic” for the lower court order that “injures the United States by compelling it to speak to foreign governments in contravention of both the President’s foreign policy and scientific reality.”

Opposing the administration, the plaintiffs told the high court that they were only seeking “the same thing millions of Americans take for granted: passports that allow them to travel without fear of misidentification, harassment, or violence.” They said the administration’s preferred policy deprives them “of a usable identification document and the ability to travel safely.”

https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/doj-preparing-subpoenas-investigation-john-brennan-rcna242338,msnbc,DOJ preparing subpoenas in investigation into John Brennan,Ken Dilanian,2025-11-06T15:58:40.853Z,"The Department of Justice is preparing to issue a series of grand jury subpoenas as part of a South Florida-based investigation into former CIA Director John Brennan and the probes by the CIA and FBI into Russian interference in the 2016 election, MSNBC has learned.

The investigation is being supervised by the U.S. attorney in South Florida, Jason Reding Quiñones, in consultation with Justice Department senior staff in Washington, according to a source familiar with the matter and other information obtained by MSNBC.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

The Florida-based inquiry comes two years after a special counsel appointed by then-Attorney General Bill Barr concluded a lengthy and exhaustive investigation that found no criminal wrongdoing by Brennan or any other major figure connected with the Russian election interference matter. Barr had appointed the special counsel in late 2020, during the first Trump administration.

A White House spokesman confirmed the existence of the grand jury investigation in August after Fox News reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the probe based on a criminal referral from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

The fact that subpoenas are being prepared has not previously been reported. Among the topics of interest in the new investigation is the preparation of the 2017 intelligence assessment into Russian election interference. That also was investigated by special counsel John Durham, who found no wrongdoing in its preparation.

Conservative attorney Mike Davis, who advises the White House and the Justice Department, has said in recent weeks that a Florida grand jury will consider whether top Obama and Biden officials engaged in a massive conspiracy to violate Donald Trump’s civil rights through the Russia investigations and the probes by special counsel Jack Smith.

Trump was charged federally in two separate cases brought by Smith, both of which were dismissed when he became president. No evidence has surfaced publicly of wrongdoing in those probes or the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, other than by an FBI lawyer in the Russia investigation who pleaded guilty in 2020 to falsifying a document related to surveillance of a Trump campaign aide.

But Trump and his allies have for years claimed that the FBI and Justice Department conspired with Democrats to frame him.

Brennan, an MSNBC national security contributor, has denied wrongdoing. He has separately been accused by the House Judiciary Committee of lying to Congress, an allegation he also disputes.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported on a temporary restraining order handed down by U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman concerning the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, which has become the epicenter of Trump’s military-assisted crackdown . The order came after a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees alleged they had experienced “horrific and inhumane” conditions, including being denied access to food, water, medical care and hygiene.

As the Sun-Times reports :

In issuing the two-week temporary restraining order in the case, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman wrote detainees at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement center ‘have suffered, and are likely to suffer, irreparable harm’ absent his order.

Among other demands, the judge is requiring officials at the ICE facility to provide detainees with a clean bedding mat ‘with sufficient space to sleep;’ adequate supplies of soap, toilet paper, towels, oral hygiene and menstrual products; a shower for at least every other day; three full meals with water per day; and prescribed medication. Holding cells must be cleaned twice per day.

The order also requires detainees be ensured communication with attorneys in privacy, a list of attorneys available for hire and access to a phone. The feds also will be required to enter each detainee into an ICE online detainee locator system.

After the judge’s order, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin flatly denied the plaintiffs’ claims, saying in a statement : “All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers. No one is denied access to proper medical care.”

This is hardly the only immigration facility facing such allegations, as I’ve noted . And at times, the Trump administration has seemed eager to use the notorious conditions of its facilities as a warning to other undocumented immigrants.

I also recently wrote about Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s boast that the use of a “legendary” facility in Louisiana — a notoriously abusive slave plantation turned penitentiary — would encourage some immigrants to leave on their own."
https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-roberts-gorsuch-rcna242188,msnbc,Trump's solicitor general stumbled at the Supreme Court. That may not matter.,"Ray Brescia,professor of law, Albany Law School, Ray Brescia",2025-11-06T11:00:00.000Z,"For almost three hours at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, Solicitor General John Sauer struggled to justify President Donald Trump’s sweeping use of the tariff power . He f aced tough questions not just from the court’s liberals , but from conservative justices such as Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Sauer’s struggles, however, do not mean the conservative justices on the Supreme Court will rule against the president — even though the Constitution, the plain text of the relevant statute, and this Court’s past rulings strongly argue against the administration.

In a marathon oral argument, Sauer — a former personal attorney for Trump — squared off against veteran Supreme Court litigator Neal Katyal and Oregon Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman in a series of cases challenging the president’s deployment of sweeping tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. While the justices across the ideological spectrum asked both lawyers challenging questions, Sauer seemed to have the tougher day, as he was peppered from the right and left (literally and figuratively) with questions that might lead the average observer of the Court to conclude that the president is unlikely to prevail.

Despite delegating many tactics a president could deploy with respect to foreign commerce, Congress never explicitly included tariffs in that grant.

Justice Elena Kagan asked Sauer to find the word “tariff” in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , the statute upon which the administration relied. Hint: It’s not in there (while it is present in dozens of other statutes). The IEEPA provides for a wide range of powers, including the right to “regulate” foreign commerce. But despite delegating many tactics a president could deploy with respect to foreign commerce, Congress never explicitly included tariffs in that grant.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor also challenged Sauer on his assertion that the tariff power is “foreign facing” and therefore resides in the president’s inherent power to regulate foreign affairs. But as Justice Neil Gorsuch noted, there are a lot of other “foreign-facing” powers, such as the power to declare war, that are clearly powers the Constitution assigns to Congress in Article I .

Similarly, the Constitution also grants the so-called foreign-facing authority to impose tariffs to Congress . Just because there are elements of a governmental power that touches upon foreign affairs does not mean that it is automatically something the president has the inherent power to exercise in an unconstrained way, especially when that power is explicitly reserved to Congress by the Constitution.

Which brings us to another bit of questioning that Sauer faced: How does one square the exercise of the tariff power in these cases with the framework first introduced by Justice Robert Jackson in the landmark case on presidential powers: Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer ?

In that case, President Harry Truman sought to nationalize American steel mills during the Korean War due to a union strike at those facilities that Truman feared could undermine the war effort. The Court found the president did not have the authority to seize the mills, even during a time of war. In his concurrence, Jackson explained that when the president acts in a manner authorized by Congress and has any additional powers by virtue of related executive-branch authority, the executive’s power is at its height. But Jackson also said that when the president “takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.”

The biggest problem for Sauer was posed by Chief Justice John Roberts.

The concurrence has been a touchstone in cases involving presidential power since, with Wednesday’s oral argument the latest example of its influence. When questioned by Justice Clarence Thomas, Sauer argued that the uses of the tariff power at issue in these cases were an exercise of that first category of authority. But any fair reading of the statute and the tariff power as laid out in the Constitution strongly suggests that this exercise is more likely at the “lowest ebb” of presidential authority. As such, the president has greatly limited power.

But the biggest problem for Sauer was posed by Chief Justice John Roberts. He asked Sauer how a doctrine that the Court has crafted in recent years , the so-called “major questions doctrine,” might apply to this case. The doctrine requires that on issues of great significance, Congress must make a direct and clear grant of authority to the president before the executive branch can act. The Court cited this doctrine, for instance, in striking down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan, because the Court’s conservative majority determined that when Congress said the president could “modify” student loans, that did not mean that he could “forgive” them.

If you’re wondering how the same court that would not read the word “modify” to mean “forgive” could interpret the term “regulate” to mean “impose a tariff,” you’re not alone.

Even if Sauer convinces a majority of the court that words such as “regulate” in the IEEPA could include tariffs, and that it is similarly ambiguous whether Congress authorized the president to take actions the Constitution assigns to Congress, that still leaves the major questions doctrine to overcome. It is precisely the apparent ambiguity surrounding those first two issues that, at a minimum, should trigger the major questions doctrine — with poor results for the president.

Of course, none of this may matter. Yes, the Court just has to follow its recent precedent on any one of these issues in order to rule against the president. But given this Court’s record, whether it will act in a manner consistent with precedent remains to be seen. Anything short of it doing so would just confirm the fears of those who believe that this Court has different rules for presidents of different political parties.

https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ice-cbp-border-patrol-facial-recognition-tech-immigrants-rcna241020,msnbc,ICE and CBP’s use of facial recognition technology needs guardrails — now,"Patrick G. Eddington,senior fellow at the Cato Institute, Patrick G. Eddington",2025-11-06T11:00:40.000Z,"According to stunning reporting by Joseph Cox at 404 Media, federal agents appear to be roaming around Chicago using mobile facial recognition technology , or FRT, on people to determine whether they should be deported.

And according to internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, emails viewed by 404 Media , ICE has been using the Mobile Fortify app, which “can identify someone based on their fingerprints or face by simply pointing a smartphone camera at them.” A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection confirmed its use of Mobile Fortify to 404 Media, saying, “This is one of many tools we are using as we enforce the laws of our nation.” A DHS spokesperson told MSNBC, ""While the Department does not discuss specific vendors or operational tools, any technology used by DHS Components must comply with the requirements and oversight framework.""

The implications of DHS’ use of facial recognition technology go far beyond the realm of immigration enforcement.

Based on 404 Media’s review of videos, it appears that agents from ICE and CBP were utilizing the technology at least as early as February 2025 in New Mexico. But agents reportedly employed the technology in Chicago on young people riding bikes, and also on an adult driver who explicitly declared their U.S. citizenship to agents. Nonetheless, the video shows agents demanding that the driver submit to an FRT scan to verify their citizenship status.

The incidents out of Chicago should shake the American conscience. But they should also serve as a warning that, if left unchecked, immigration enforcement’s use of this technology could potentially trigger a constitutional crisis.

In one of the most controversial Supreme Court “shadow docket” decisions this year, by a 6-3 majority in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo , the justices stayed a lower court ban on immigration enforcement stops based on a person’s presence “at particular locations such as bus stops, car washes, day laborer pickup sites, agricultural sites, and the like; (ii) the type of work one does; (iii) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; and (iv) apparent race or ethnicity.” Thus, while the Vasquez Perdomo case remains on appeal at the Ninth Circuit, the high court’s majority is permitting ICE to use race and the other factors above in making immigration-related stops or even raids.

And contrary to Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s assertion in his concurring opinion that “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go,” that clearly has not happened in at least 170 cases in which U.S. citizens were detained by ICE thus far in 2025. Many of them said they were physically abused, as reported this month by ProPublica .

If you’re in the vicinity of ICE operations and you don’t look like you’re of European ancestry, you could be a potential target. Speaking Spanish in public even as a U.S. citizen? An involuntary FRT scan and possible detention at the hands of ICE or other DHS agents is a very real and frightening possibility.

Nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act permits ICE to conduct involuntary FRT scans — but neither does the statute prohibit it. In fact, there’s no federal legislation governing FRT use at all at this point, despite the fact that there are documented cases of FRT-based false arrest cases from 2020 , 2023 and 2024 . The lack of federal legal restraints on FRT use is being exploited by ICE and its fellow federal law enforcement agencies, to the detriment of the constitutional rights of those they target.

In the air travel context, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley’s Traveler Privacy Protection Act would, if enacted, impose meaningful FRT constraints on the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA. What’s required more broadly is a federal ban on the use of FRT technology absent express congressional authorization and only in circumstances in which a particular person is being sought in connection with a violent crime. In no case should an arrest be made solely on the basis of an allegedly positive FRT result.

However, the implications of DHS’ use of FRT — backed up by reams of personal and public information on tens of millions of Americans — go far beyond the realm of immigration enforcement.

An involuntary FRT scan and possible detention at the hands of ICE or other DHS agents is a very real and frightening possibility.

Earlier this year and in the name of “immigration enforcement,” Trump’s Justice Department demanded voter roll data from several states , escalating to lawsuits to obtain the information. Just last week, the department upped the ante, announcing it would send election monitors to New Jersey and California in November, despite the fact that there is no obvious legal justification for doing so.

In theory, there is no constitutional, statutory or case law basis for Justice Department election monitors to demand that a voter submit to FRT to verify their identity and citizenship status prior to casting a vote in a federal election. However, given the administration’s penchant for testing constitutional boundaries, state and local election officials would be unwise to ignore the possibility.

Consider the following scenario: Trump’s Justice Department could attempt to employ FRT or other forms of voter verification protocols outside of polling places, asserting the need to prevent voter fraud by illegal immigrants or others allegedly ineligible to vote. State and local officials could refuse to allow federal monitors near polling places if they attempted to employ such measures. But that could trigger Trump to claim voter fraud was being perpetrated — and all because his monitors were prevented from stopping illegal immigrants or others ineligible from casting ballots. This would be especially politically explosive in areas where House races are decided by razor-thin margins and recounts take place.

The legal battle to decide the constitutionality — or lack thereof — of Trump’s actions would likely be won by state and local officials, but if enough House races were called into question, it could lead to a House election certification fight similar to the presidential election certification battle of 2020-21 —and thus another constitutional crisis.

https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/voter-anger-tuesday-election-republicans-rcna242246,msnbc,Republicans didn’t have a chance Tuesday against the wave of voters’ anger,"Paul Waldman,author and commentator, Paul Waldman",2025-11-06T11:00:40.000Z,"The most important takeaway from Tuesday night’s elections — the one that has real implications for 2026 and 2028 — is that Democrats won everywhere , in many cases improving their 2024 performance by striking margins.

Democratic candidates didn’t just win the highest-profile races in Virginia, New Jersey and New York, but they also won judicial retention elections in Pennsylvania and a variety of down-ballot races . They even picked up seats in the Mississippi Legislature — which cost Republicans their supermajority — and ousted two Republican incumbents on the Georgia commission that regulates utilities.

Democratic candidates didn’t just win the highest-profile races in Virginia, New Jersey and New York.

More moderate Democrats, more progressive Democrats, Democrats who were well-known and Democrats who weren’t, Democrats who ran explicitly against Donald Trump and those who barely mentioned him — they all did great.

Nonetheless, Speaker Mike Johnson insisted Wednesday that the GOP couldn’t be healthier. “I don’t think the loss last night was any reflection about Republicans at all,” he said . Johnson couldn’t be more wrong, not only because in today’s GOP where loyalty to Trump is absolute, every Republican everywhere is an avatar for the president — which is not something candidates want to be right now — but because of the overwhelming power of opposition to the status quo.

When we see a string of wins like the one Democrats put together Tuesday, we can’t attribute it to clever strategy, blistering attack ads or even attribute it to the skills of the candidates they nominated — but to widespread opposition to the party in charge of the country.

Look at the two governor’s races. It appeared that the race in New Jersey was much closer than the one in Virginia, and many people who thought it was closer believed that Democrats had a much stronger candidate in Virginia than New Jersey and that Republicans had a much stronger candidate in New Jersey than they did in Virginia. The thinking was that Virginia’s Abigail Spanberger was more appealing than the more low-key Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, while Republican Winsome Earle-Sears was more polarizing than her New Jersey counterpart Jack Ciattarelli.

But in the end, the results were almost identical: Spanberger won with 57% of the vote, and Sherrill won with 56%. Such a uniform outcome suggests deep factors at work that transcended individual candidates.

The first factor, of course, is Donald Trump. Off-year elections favor the opposition party, largely because those who are angry at the president are more likely to turn out as a way to express their displeasure, and anger is the most powerful motivator in politics.

When Trump is in office, the anger gets cranked up as far as it can go.

When Trump is in office, the anger gets cranked up as far as it can go. The first year of his second term has been chaos, with his army of thugs terrorizing people in cities, erratic tariffs dragging down the economy, brutal cuts to Medicaid and SNAP and the evisceration of the federal government. Every Democrat benefited from the displeasure Trump produced, whether they campaigned on opposing him or not.

Even more fundamentally, there is a profound dissatisfaction blanketing the country. Trump may have made it worse, but it was there before he came along — and it’s exactly why he became president twice.

In 2024, “inflation” was the name we put to that dissatisfaction, even though the inflation that peaked in 2022 had largely subsided. Now we refer to “cost of living” or “affordability,” which are very real problems, but only part of a bigger picture.

People still say their groceries are too expensive, housing is unaffordable for all but the wealthy in much of the country and many young people see home ownership as unattainable. Health insurance costs are rising .

But the dissatisfaction is still bigger than that. We’ve seen a decadeslong decline in trust in institutions, internet-driven social fragmentation, the failure of neoliberal economics to satisfy people’s material needs and a calcified legislative system that is perpetually unable to solve problems. The result is an electorate perpetually eager to get rid of whoever is in office in favor of anyone who promises something different.

It’s been this way for a while. There have been five presidential elections and five midterm elections over the past two decades. And in nine of those 10 elections (2012 was the exception), voters chose to throw the bums out, giving either the White House or one or both houses of Congress to the opposition party. We are in an era in which every election is a change election , and the party that represents change is probably going to win.

It’s wrong-headed to assume that what happens in one election represents any kind of lasting reconfiguration of the electorate.

That’s why it’s so wrong-headed to assume that what happens in one election represents any kind of lasting reconfiguration of the electorate. How many think pieces did we read a year ago about how Trump had fundamentally remade the GOP coalition, in part by convincing Latinos to become Republican? No one is saying that after Tuesday. Consider, for example, New Jersey’s Passaic County, which is 45% Latino . In 2020, Joe Biden beat Trump there by 16.5 points. But then it swung dramatically to the right in 2024, with Trump beating Kamala Harris by 3 points.

It would be foolish in the extreme to believe that voters were responding to subtle alterations in policy platforms or the success of one government program or another. But that doesn’t mean that elections are predetermined. Zohran Mamdani, who was elected mayor of New York City on Tuesday, may have been fighting a mostly intraparty battle, but his relentless focus on affordability and his infectious enthusiasm placed him in a position to overcome a corrupt establishment. If voters are unhappy — and they almost always are — showing that you understand their displeasure and offering the possibility of something better can make the difference, especially when races are close.

The big picture is this: Candidates can ride the tide, try to swim against it, or just lay there and hope it carries them in. But the tide matters more than anything. Next year and in 2028, Democrats will have the tide on their side.

As for Republicans, as long as they’re in power, they’re trapped — by the unpopularity of the president they slavishly serve and the limited appeal of their program. The country is not clamoring for more upper-end tax cuts and restrictions on abortion rights, and the GOP can’t pretend to be rebels fighting the power.

Voter anger put them in charge, and it will probably yank them right out again.

https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-election-winners-trans-rights-rcna242214,msnbc,Democrats’ big election wins showed they don’t need to hide their support for trans rights,"Katelyn Burns,MSNBC Columnist, Katelyn Burns",2025-11-06T00:27:36.079Z,"The past 12 months have been the most difficult politically for trans people since Time magazine’s “Trans Tipping Point” cover story in 2015. Donald Trump returned to the White House after a campaign that featured millions of dollars of anti-trans ads. Since then, the Democratic Party and those paid to pontificate on party strategy have been in a tense standoff over whether they should give up the fight for trans rights and give in to the conservative lust to drive trans people out of society.

Tuesday’s election night was a resounding repudiation of those who insist that Democrats must cut their trans constituents loose in order to win elections.

In Virginia, over half of Republican ads fearmongered over trans acceptance in schools, but Democratic candidates weren’t afraid to respond to those attacks. The anti-trans ads from Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears were relentless , but Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger didn’t hesitate to respond , telling her story as a mother of three girls and how Earle-Sears’ concerns should be left to parents, not the government.

Tuesday’s election night was a resounding repudiation of those who insist that Democrats must cut their trans constituents loose in order to win elections.

A similar story played out in the New Jersey governor’s race , in which Republicans again tried to distract from kitchen table issues by parading the alleged threat of trans people in front of voters. In countless local races, from the Virginia House of Delegates to local school board races in Texas, anti-trans candidates faced loss after loss. The Pennsylvania small town of Downingtown even elected the state’s first-ever openly trans mayor.

Republicans nationwide have made attacking trans rights a major element of their campaign messaging, despite fast-rising inflation, but those attacks didn’t appear to land. According to CNN exit polling in Virginia , about half of all voters said societal support for transgender rights has gone too far, but about 20% of those who said so ended up voting for Spanberger.

An October poll of likely voters in Virginia by the Wason Center showed that trans issues ranked low as a voter priority, polling way behind affordability, threats to democracy and concerns over policing of immigration. Nevertheless, Earle-Sears poured millions into anti-trans ads, and then got blown out on Election Day in a state that is still relatively purple.

In New York City, mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s campaign was among the most openly pro-trans in history. He regularly name-checked the trans community in speeches and hired trans people to help right his trans rights platform. He even released a two-minute video entirely about the history of trans people in the city and what he planned to do to support trans New Yorkers.

To me, as someone who has watched the trans debate develop and morph in this country’s politics for a decade now, last night was one of the most politically affirming of my life. The debate over whether Democrats need to cut trans people loose in order to win elections should be over. From Spanberger’s matter of fact responses to anti-trans attacks, or Mamdani’s full embrace of trans New Yorkers as full equals in society, Democrats now have multiple playbooks to choose from the next time a Trump acolyte hits them with a “Harris is for they/them”-type ad.

In bluer districts and states, Democrats should feel free to embrace trans people in their campaign messaging — we aren’t some tiny minority to be hidden away in the closet when voters check out your campaign. In purple races, Democrats need to ensure they are connecting with the economic needs of the people they are seeking to represent, which is something that all the major Democratic candidates did in their races this fall.

On Wednesday, the Human Rights Campaign was quick to get the word out about how successful its pro-equality caucus performed. The organization hosted a press call featuring a variety of high-profile LGBTQ+ political figures, including Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first ever openly trans House representative.

“Last night’s win reinforced the spine and reinforced that we are on the right path as a caucus and party,” said McBride when asked by MSNBC about how last night’s election results will affect conversations about trans issues with her Democratic colleagues.

The low voter salience of trans issues among voters is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, according to a 2023 Data for Progress poll , a low but growing percentage of Americans know a trans person personally. That makes us easy to define by bad actors, like Trump did last fall.

Republicans made attacking trans rights a major element of their campaign messaging, but those attacks didn’t appear to land.

On the other hand, because trans issues matter so little to most voters, attack ads should be relatively straightforward to respond to. Deflecting an attack on trans kids into messaging about the need for universal child care, or redirecting attacks on trans health care into messaging about our broken health care system needs to become second nature to Democrats seeking higher office.

One way in which Kamala Harris failed in her presidential campaign is that she largely refused to respond to Trump’s attacks, giving voters the perception that trans issues were an issue she was scared or ashamed to engage on. Just last week, the centrist group WelcomePAC produced a 352-page report telling Democrats to give up on controversial social issues such as trans rights or immigration.

That has proven wrong after Tuesday. Democrats should no longer fear the trans fight. Engage with voters, learn what they care about and design your messaging around that.

To slash refugee resettlement to historic lows while granting privilege to white South Africans, all while peddling bigoted lies about anti-white oppression in their home country, is an unmistakably racist move by the administration. It also creates problems for churches that welcome new members from around the world, including refugees from places where Christians may be facing persecution.

Many faith groups appear alarmed by the new policy. Christianity Today quoted Matthew Soerens, an executive for the Christian humanitarian organization World Relief, saying the new policy “is slamming the door on persecuted Christians, along with those persecuted for other reasons.”

Bishop Mark Seitz, chairman of the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops, issued a critical statement , urging the administration to grant “due consideration for all those who have long awaited their opportunity for relief.” He continued:

We cannot turn a blind eye to the disparate treatment of refugees currently taking place. As exemptions are considered, it is essential that they be applied consistently and without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or national origin, in accordance with longstanding domestic and international norms. Resettlement tainted by the perception of unjust discrimination is contrary to Catholic teaching and quintessential American values, grounded in our Constitution and refugee laws, including the equality of every person from the moment of their creation by God.

Several other faith-based organizations — including Church World Service , which represents a network of Christian humanitarian groups — have denounced the changes to the refugee resettlement program as well.

The administration faced backlash previously from faith groups over cuts to health care and food assistance in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as well as the administration’s harsh anti-immigration policies.

It’s ironic that these groups are sounding the alarm on the dangers and difficulties being creating for Christians abroad by an administration that has so visibly aligned itself with right-wing Christians and that portrays itself as a defender of Christianity — even as it is led by an adjudicated sex abuser who has worried publicly on several occasions that he doesn’t think he’s going to heaven.

In the first major elections of Trump's second term, his unpopularity proved a drag on Republican nominees, a sign of potential trouble for the GOP in next year's midterms.

Two Democrats who won governors races, meantime, were both first elected to the House in the 2018 midterm elections during Trump's first term.

Here's a look at what happened in seven key races:

Who won: Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a centrist former House member, defeated Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears by double digits.

Why it mattered: Spanberger first won a House seat in 2018 by running against Trump and she repeated that campaign tactic , tying Earle-Sears to his policies whenever possible.

What she said: In her victory speech, Spanberger criticized the federal government shutdown. “Virginia’s economy doesn’t work when Washington treats our Virginia workers as expendable,” she said . “And to those across the Potomac who are attacking our jobs and our economy, I will not stand by silently.”

Who won: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo (running as an independent) by nine points, while Republican Curtis Sliwa came in a distant third.

Why it mattered: Trump repeatedly singled out Mamdani for criticism, threatening to withhold federal funding from the city if he won and urging voters to back Cuomo. Mamdani called himself ""Donald Trump's worst nightmare"" and pledged to fight him on key issues.

What he said: ""In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light. Here, we believe in standing up for those we love, whether you are an immigrant, a member of the trans community, one of the many Black women that Donald Trump has fired from a federal job, a single mom still waiting for the cost of groceries to go down or anyone else with their back against the wall, your struggle is ours too.. We can respond to oligarchy and authoritarianism with the strength it fears, not the appeasement it craves. After all, if anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. ... So Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up.""

Who won: Democrat Mikie Sherrill, who also first won a House seat in the 2018 midterms, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli by double digits.

Why it mattered: Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost a governor's race four years ago after keeping his distance from Trump, ran with his full endorsement this time. Sherrill, meantime, tied him to Trump's handling of the economy and the recent SNAP food aid cuts, among other things.

What she said: ""As the president is backing away from this ideal, cutting SNAP, ripping away health care, terminating Gateway , we here in New Jersey are bound to fight for a different future for our children,"" she said . ""We see how clearly important liberty is. We know that no one in our great state is safe when our neighbors are targeted, ignoring the law and the Constitution.""

What happened: A ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to adopt a Democratic redistricting plan as a counter to Republican attempts to gerrymander other states passed resoundingly .

Why it mattered: The measure will allow California to redraw its maps to offset the Texas redistricting passed earlier this year, helping Democrats stay competitive in next year's midterms.

What they said: “What a night for the Democratic Party — a party that is in its ascendancy, a party that’s on its toes, no longer on its heels,” Newsom said .

What happened: A conservative-backed ballot measure to add new restrictions on voting by mail and require photo ID before casting a ballot, among other changes, lost by double digits.

Why it mattered: The measure was the latest attempt to impose more stringent requirements on voting, echoing many of the changes that Trump has called for since losing in 2020. These restrictions have tended to fare poorly on the ballot, however, as voters like voting.

What they said: “Maine voters know that our elections are safe and secure, and they sent a loud message today that they will fight to protect voting rights,” David Farmer, campaign manager for the group Save Maine Absentee Voting, said in a statement .

What happened: Three Democratic justices on the state Supreme Court won retention votes by double digits after an unusually aggressive Republican campaign to unseat them.

Why it mattered: Democrats will likely still have a majority on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court during the 2028 presidential election, when they might be called on to resolve election-related lawsuits. Two of the justices won 10-year terms, while the third will serve until she turns 75 in 2027, the state's mandatory retirement age for justices.

What they said: ""I’m really honored that the people showed this confidence in me,"" Justice David Wecht told NBC News . ""I intend to serve the people with fidelity.""

What happened: Democratic Mayor Aftab Pureval overwhelmingly defeated Republican Cory Bowman in the race, which is technically for a nonpartisan post.

Why it mattered: Bowman is Vice President JD Vance’s half-brother and said he was inspired to run when he was attending the inauguration.

What they said: Pureval said Bowman called to concede even before the race was called and was ""very classy."" He said he offered him an opportunity to work together, which Bowman said he would accept.

https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dick-cheney-dead-trump-legacy-rcna241949,msnbc,Dick Cheney's unforgivable legacy includes helping give rise to Trump,"Zeeshan Aleem,MSNBC Opinion Writer/Editor, Zeeshan Aleem",2025-11-05T11:00:41.000Z,"Dick Cheney, who was a Republican congressman, defense secretary and one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history, has died at age 84 . His influence in the George W. Bush administration, including his role as an architect of the brutal “war on terror,” earned him enmity from the administration’s Democratic foes. But his criticism of President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection rehabilitated his image in the eyes of some Democrats. Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 even praised Cheney for “what he has done to serve our country” after he endorsed her for president in 2024.

Cheney was right about the threat that Trump posed, and continues to pose, to our democracy. But there is no need to downplay his own grave misdeeds in the wake of his death — not just because the darkest parts of his legacy were unforgivable, but because they helped set the stage for Trump.

Cheney was a crucial figure in introducing elaborate lies into the American mind.

As vice president under Bush, such was Cheney’s power that friend and foe alike likened him to Darth Vader — a comparison Cheney himself embraced . He was obsessed with maintaining U.S. global hegemony around the world and he did everything in his power to enact that goal. He was a hawk among hawks in the “war on terror.” He played a major role in creating new regimes of torture, invasive surveillance and imprisonment of innocents . He was instrumental in the Bush administration’s lies about weapons of mass destruction in order to justify the war in Iraq. And long before Trump embraced blatant conflicts of interest, the Bush administration doled out generous contracts to Halliburton, the oil and gas services company of which Cheney was the chief executive before entering the vice presidency.

It’s misguided to compartmentalize Cheney's national security policies — because they help explain some of how the U.S. got where it is today. The falsehoods in the run-up to the Iraq War went far beyond just motivated reasoning or fudged data. As Vox’s Dylan Matthews put it in 2016, “there were numerous occasions when Bush and his advisers made statements that intelligence agencies knew to be false, both about WMDs and about Saddam Hussein’s nonexistent links to al-Qaeda. The term commonly used for making statements that one knows to be false is ‘lying.’”

The Trump administration lies differently than the Bush administration did — it lies about more things and with less sophistication. But Cheney was a crucial figure in introducing elaborate lies into the American mind in the 21st century to justify overturning a nation’s right to self-determination. Those lies resulted in extraordinary loss of life and money. And nobody was held accountable for it. That should be understood as something that takes a serious toll on a democracy.

Moreover, the results of the disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq contributed to the trust crisis that Trump exploited in his rise to power. One key way that Trump broke from the GOP establishment during his first run for president was criticizing both wars as pointless mistakes that had cost lives needlessly. He successfully channeled disillusionment with neoconservative nation-building toward a foreign policy oriented more narrowly around U.S. interests. Republican voters didn’t punish Trump for questioning post-9/11 security orthodoxy — they rewarded him with more support.

Cheney was also a major player in helping advance the imperial presidency that Trump benefits from today. In a 2008 interview, The New York Times’ Charlie Savage , the author of “Takeover: The Return of the Imperial Presidency and the Subversion of Democracy,” described Cheney as “the driving force behind the Bush administration’s systematic and highly successful project to expand presidential power, a push that was articulated on their first day in office, long before 9/11, and whose first battleground was the fight over whether Cheney would have to comply with open-government laws that mandated that he tell Congress and the public whom his energy task force had met with.”

He added, “The second President Bush adopted Cheney’s view that they ought to use their time in office to strengthen presidential power as an end to itself — to leave the office stronger than it had been when they inherited it — and that is what they set out to do.” Cheney wasn’t involved in a project to turn the president into a total autocrat. But he contributed to the degradation of checks on presidential power.

Cheney was never made to answer for his role in a project of global domination that cost millions of lives — or for helping to create legal paradigms and norms that reshaped our country for the worse. That Cheney wanted the U.S. to remain a republic and opposed Trump’s autocratic ambition does nothing to erase or mitigate his many terrible acts.

https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/megyn-kelly-zohran-mamdani-ben-shapiro-islam-antisemitism-rcna242187,msnbc,Megyn Kelly doesn’t think Muslims should hold office in America. There’s a word for that.,"Anthony L. Fisher,Senior Editor, MSNBC Daily, Anthony L. Fisher",2025-11-07T11:00:42.000Z,"MAGA thought leader Ben Shapiro made headlines earlier this week when he unloaded on his former friend and political ally Tucker Carlson over the latter’s chummy interview with the unabashed antisemite and white nationalist Nick Fuentes . Shapiro correctly accused Carlson of “normalizing” the vile identity-based hatred emanating from Fuentes and his followers, and called Carlson an “intellectual coward, a dishonest interlocutor and a terrible friend.”

Let’s not kid ourselves, racism and other forms of intolerance are already fully normalized within the MAGA movement.

As the conservative firewall that once isolated Fuentes as a “fringe” kook crumbles, MAGA is at war with itself. On one side, overt bigots such as Fuentes and Carlson have become increasingly critical of Israel and more open about their antisemitism . On the other side, pro-Israel right-wingers such as Shapiro who seemed comfortable with intolerance when it was directed at Blacks, immigrants, trans people and other marginalized groups, are shocked (shocked!) that their former friends also hate Jews.

The conundrum lies with mainstream MAGA stars like Shapiro wanting to clean the bigotry out of their house on an a la carte basis — but fear and loathing of “the other” is as MAGA as a red baseball cap. The ideological civil war over the increasing popularity of Fuentes (especially among young men) in the MAGA movement is a Spider-Man pointing meme come to life. The hate is coming from inside the house .

Case in point: Hours before New York City voters elected Zohran Mamdani as their next mayor, MAGA podcast superstar Megyn Kelly delivered a rant against the New York state assemblyman that was both chillingly prejudiced and comically un-self-aware.

Sounding very much like Archie Bunker with a law degree , Kelly said Mamdani, a U.S. citizen born in Uganda, is “not American,” and that Muslims “should not be ascending to our mayors and our governors” because “the tenets of Islam are not consistent with Western civilization.”

The xenophobic diatribe came a week after Kelly declared , “I do have a problem with Islam. I do. I think it’s totally incompatible with Western values and I don’t think people who practice Islam should be the leaders of America. I just don’t. That’s how I feel and I’m entitled to that belief because Islam is more than a religion. It is a political ideology…All of Islam is political Islam. That’s the truth. And we can’t be afraid to say it.”

Attempting to anticipate the counterargument that America is a nation of immigrants, Kelly retorted , “Yeah. Like immigrants like my grandfather from Italy, and then my grandfather on the other side from Ireland, who desperately wanted to assimilate. But if they didn’t … you’d have some guy with an Irish brogue eating a lot of meat and potatoes and drinking a lot. That was the most significant downside to the Irish not potentially assimilating. It’s a very different story when you’re talking about immigrants from Uganda who are Muslim at a minimum and potentially radicalized Muslims.”

“Muslim at a minimum.”

Fear and loathing of “the other” is as MAGA as a red baseball cap.

It’s apparently lost on Kelly that religious tolerance is a founding tenet of the United States. And indicting millions of Muslims as inherently dangerous and untrustworthy isn’t fearless iconoclasm — it’s gutter bigotry. It’s un-American. And it’s very difficult to believe Ben Shapiro, an Orthodox Jew, would be OK with another MAGA influencer declaring all Jews to be unfit for public office or disloyal to America.

Like Kelly, I’m an American descended from Italian and Irish immigrants. Unlike Kelly, I’m not oblivious to the connection between her xenophobic fulminations about Muslims and the kind of discrimination directed at our immigrant ancestors.

Irish immigrants in the 19th century were regularly met with “ No Irish Need Apply ” declarations in job listings. A Harper’s Weekly political cartoon from 1871 depicts an Irish immigrant as an ape waving a rum bottle , sitting on a gunpowder keg. In the early 20th century, the next wave of immigrants to America included many southern Europeans — and Italians were often depicted in the mainstream press as racially inferior criminals.

A New York Times editorial in 1891 deplored the public lynchings of 11 Italian immigrants in New Orleans, while also saying the victims were “sneaking and cowardly Sicilians, the descendants of bandits and assassins … to us a pest without mitigations.”

As for Kelly’s assertion that Islam is a “political ideology,” both Italians and Irish — two groups with large Catholic populations — were accused of being politically loyal to the Pope in Rome. When John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960, he felt it necessary to give a televised address declaring that “contrary to common newspaper usage, I am not the Catholic candidate for president.”

As Kelly demonstrates, xenophobia’s practitioners usually consider past immigrants the “good ones” who loved America and assimilated instantly, but are certain the next wave will be made up of fifth columnists hell-bent on bringing the country down from the inside.

And let’s not kid ourselves, racism and other forms of intolerance are already fully normalized within the MAGA movement.

Last week, Vice President JD Vance repeated the debunked racist slander he pushed during the 2024 election that Haitian immigrants were stealing and eating their neighbors’ pets. Last month, Vance quickly came to the defense of a group of young Republican leaders who were exposed as participants in a racist and antisemitic group chat.

MAGA bankroller Elon Musk has endorsed antisemitic conspiracy theories and backed the Nazi-sympathizing German political party Alternative for Germany (AfD). And, of course, President Donald Trump’s got a long track record as MAGA’s bigot-in-chief .

Indicting millions of Muslims as inherently dangerous and untrustworthy isn’t fearless iconoclasm — it’s gutter bigotry.

Speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition Leadership Summit this week, Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., said, “I just want to make it really clear: I’m in the ‘Hitler sucks’ wing of the Republican Party.” He smiled, selling it as a joke — but many a truth is said in jest. If there’s a “Hitler sucks” wing of the GOP, then the opposite wing, by definition, does not think “Hitler sucks.”

Meanwhile, after the election, Kelly endorsed MAGA intellectual architect Steve Bannon’s commentary on Mamdani’s victory: “Forty to fifty years of visa scams and ten to fifteen million illegal alien invaders, that’s what you end up with. If you don’t think that’s a reality check, you’re not paying attention.”

Shapiro and his allies may want to exorcise Carlson, Fuentes and other antisemites in MAGA’s midst. But if rooting out identity-based hatred and conspiracy theories about the sinister “other” is the goal (and it should be), MAGA’s big tent will have to get a whole lot smaller.

Photos of the East Wing façade being demolished went viral Monday, prompting criticism online and a swift rebuttal from the White House, which wrote that ""unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom … a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence a beacon of American excellence.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt echoed the president's message Tuesday on ""Jesse Watters Primetime,"" saying, ""I believe there’s a lot of fake outrage right now.

HILLARY CLINTON FIRES UP VOTERS AGAINST TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM CONSTRUCTION: 'NOT HIS HOUSE'' ""Nearly every single president who’s lived in this beautiful White House behind me has made modernizations and renovations of their own,"" Leavitt added. ""In fact, presidents for decades — in modern times — have joked about how they wished they had a larger event space here at the White House, something that could hold hundreds more people than the current East Room and State Dining Room.

""President Obama even complained that, during his tenure, he had to hold a state dinner on the South Lawn and rent a very expensive tent.""

In an article shared Tuesday , the administration listed more than a dozen examples of leaders ""renovating, expanding and modernizing"" the property to ""meet the needs of the present day,"" from Theodore Roosevelt’s West Wing in 1902 to Barack Obama’s Kitchen Garden in 2009. Trump first confirmed the ballroom project Monday on Truth Social, writing, ""I am pleased to announce that ground has been broken … to build the new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom. Completely separate from the White House itself, the East Wing is being fully modernized … and will be more beautiful than ever when it is complete!""

""For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom … I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway — with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!"" he continued, crediting ""many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and yours truly"" for funding the build. ""This Ballroom will be happily used for Generations to come!""

The White House's Rapid Response 47 account also shared a detailed thread on X Tuesday showing how past presidents ""have been renovating, expanding, and modernizing the White House to meet the needs of the current day.""

TRUMP BREAKS GROUND ON MASSIVE WHITE HOUSE BALLROOM PROJECT WITH PRIVATE FUNDING FROM 'PATRIOTS'

Trump elaborated Tuesday, calling the federal government ""this big for nothing.""

""We’re building a world-class ballroom,"" he said. ""You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back here. That’s music to my ears. People don’t like it. I love it. When I hear that sound, it reminds me of money. In this case, a lack of money, because I’m paying for it.""

Trump also noted that the East Room, currently the largest indoor event space, is little more than ""a cocktail area"" that holds about 88 people.

During a Diwali event at the White House Tuesday night, Trump again referenced the project and his decision not to accept a salary, quipping that ""they probably owe me a lot of money"" for everything he’s put into the building.

""If I get money from our country, I’ll do something nice with it. Like give it to charity or give it to the White House,"" he said. ""We restore the White House, and we’re doing a great job. The ballroom is under construction. They’ve been trying to get it for 150 years.""

TPUSA spokesman Andrew Kolvet confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that its church network has reached 8,000 in one of the largest growth spikes in the organization’s history.

Kolvet added that more than 200,000 new Christians have become involved with TPUSA Faith nationwide, and the organization’s social media accounts have seen over 1,000% growth across followers, views and streams in the past month.

Appearing on ""The Story,"" Kolvet told host Trace Gallagher, ""TPUSA Faith, which Charlie launched during COVID, has — so just to put it in perspective, we had about 4,000 churches in the network before 9/10. We have added over 4,000 more churches.

TPUSA SPOX HOPES TO HARNESS REVIVAL MOMENTUM AS CHURCH ATTENDANCE SOARS FOLLOWING CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION

""So, now we've doubled. We have 8,000 churches in our network at TPUSA Faith. We've seen almost 1,000% growth across all social media platforms. And get this. We've had over 200,000 people sign up to become a part of TPUSA Faith.

""So, what we're doing in the faith space has more than doubled, and it's, again, what a testament to the legacy that Charlie Kirk has left. There's just so much more good than there is bad, and it's important for us to remind everybody about that,"" Kolvet added.

Kolvet said the growth reflects a revival-like response among church communities nationwide.

""It's really encouraging for me just to see the pure raw numbers of that because you can feel it. There's so many anecdotes and so many people that have come to us, sent us emails,"" he said. ""You see it in the social media comments saying, 'Charlie re-inspired my faith. I'm going back to church. I'm praying for my husband. Our marriage has been saved because of the legacy that … and just the way Charlie lived his life.""

TPUSA Faith offers resources such as prayer groups, faith courses and a monthly devotional.

According to its mission statement , ""TPUSA Faith is dedicated to empowering Christians to put their faith into action. We engage, equip, and empower millions of grateful Americans who are prepared to defend our God-given rights, by giving them the tools to expose lies and articulate the connection between Faith and Freedom.""

Kolvet said he credits the growth to ""the way Charlie would integrate the message of faith into everything that he did.""

""[Charlie would] get a question about, regardless of the topic, he would get a question, and he would find a way to integrate his faith just seamlessly into that,"" Kolvet said. ""And after, you know, Charlie was assassinated, people started seeing these clips, and they would realize just what he was doing with all of those interactions that he had one by one over the years and how so much wisdom was packed into these social media videos that now people are rediscovering.

""There's a tremendously twisted irony,"" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., told Fox News Digital.

John Feehery of EFB Advocacy, who served as press secretary to former Republican House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert, said, ""The most unbelievable thing"" about the shutdown is Democrats ""hurting their own constituents.""

""Democrats never shut the government down. This is the first time they've ever done this. I mean, they've let the Republicans shut the government down, but they've never done it on purpose,"" he said.

MIKE JOHNSON UNDERCUTS JOHN THUNE ON OBAMACARE NEGOTIATIONS TO END SHUTDOWN

As Senate Democrats have pushed the shutdown into the longest on record, they still aren’t ready to reopen the government, even as millions who rely on food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are only set to get partial benefits.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., and his caucus have remained firm in their demand that they get a guarantee to extend expiring Obamacare premium subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government.

Democrats have blasted President Donald Trump and his administration for threatening to not fund federal food benefits. Earlier this week, Trump said that food stamps would not be funded despite a court order requiring that they at least be partially paid for.

""They're the ones who shut down the government,"" Lummis said. ""They won't reopen it, and so they got nothing to complain about. It's within their control to reopen the government. It's in their control.""

His administration has since changed course, however, and announced in a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that Americans that rely on the benefits would receive 65% of their typical allotted amount. A federal judge then ordered the administration to fully fund food benefits by Friday.

""We're finding out that it's hurting the union workers, it's hurting air travelers, it's hurting people who rely on food stamps. I mean, it's hurting Democrats,"" Feehery said. ""Their higher priority is showing that they're tough against Trump, and they're more than happy to use their constituents as cannon fodder.""

SCHUMER, DEMS CALL 'BULL----' ON TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER FOOD STAMP SHUTDOWN THREAT

Democrats acknowledge that the pain of the shutdown can’t be ignored but remain firm that their fight to extend the healthcare subsidies is one worth having.

""Shutdowns suck. I want it over here, but I don't think we have fully come to recognize how much pain is going to exist in this country when 4 million people lose their healthcare insurance,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said. ""That's as devastating, if not more devastating, in the long run, than the pain people are feeling this month.""

Julian Epstein, former chief counsel for House Judiciary Committee Democrats, told Fox News Digital that Republicans had an opportunity to seize the narrative on healthcare.

""If I were advising Trump, I would tell him to make the case in an Oval Office address that the Democrats are voting to close the government and that it's the Republicans that want to open it. The president should also lay out his vision for controlling healthcare premiums,"" Epstein said. ""Voters are starting to tune out the invective from both sides, and all the noise. They want a clear plan for their economic concerns.""

And Feehery similarly argued Republicans should take their moment on healthcare, pointing out that Democrats are effectively delaying the discussion on Obamacare by prolonging the shutdown.

""If Republicans were smart, they would be talking about why Obamacare is fundamentally broken and how to fundamentally change that. But Republicans don't really like to talk about healthcare, which is kind of annoying,"" he said. ""But yeah, I do think that the fact that it's gone past the [Nov. 1 open enrollment] deadline has made this even more complicated.""

There is a sense on Capitol Hill that the shutdown could be coming to an end, but Republicans contend it will be up to Senate Democrats.

A dozen centrist Democrats are mulling an offer from the GOP that would guarantee a vote on the expiring subsidies after the government reopens, coupled with the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) and a trio of spending bills to jump start the government funding process.

SENATE DEMS EMBOLDENED IN SHUTDOWN STRATEGY AFTER ELECTION SWEEP

But many in the caucus say that’s not enough, and demand that Trump sit down and meet with Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to hash out a deal.

Democrats also believe that Republicans are feeling the heat from Tuesday night’s elections, where Democratic candidates swept their Republican opponents in statewide elections, and they point to comments Trump made that the shutdown was hurting the GOP.

Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., contended that what Trump meant was Democrats were using the shutdown ""to fire up their base.""

""But I think it's also incredibly sad that SNAP recipients and federal workers and their families and Head Start families all had to go without so they could help the New York City election ,"" Lankford said. ""And that's pretty sad.""

Meanwhile, Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., who is running for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, told Fox News Digital, ""Every day the Schumer Shutdown drags on, Americans pay the price — missed paychecks, canceled flights, and threats to public safety. Democrats aren’t helping anyone, they’re sowing chaos and achieving nothing.""

Still, Democrats largely remain firm that the only off-ramp they want starts at the White House.

""Shutdowns are terrible. I mean, I don't know what to tell you,"" Sen. Bryan Schatz, D-Hawaii, told Fox News Digital. ""It's really awful what people are going through. And the only way out of this is a negotiation.""

""We're looking at it because it's very difficult for him to get the oil and gas from other areas,"" Trump said Friday when asked by the media if he is prepared to grant Orbán's request for an exemption. ""As you know, they don't have, they don't have the advantage of having seas. It's a great country.

""It's a big country. But they don't have sea, they don't have the ports,"" he continued. ""And so they have a difficult problem. There's another country that has that same problem, by the way. But when you look at what's happened with Europe, many of those countries, they don't have those problems, and they buy a lot of oil and gas from Russia. And, as you know, I'm very disturbed by that because we're helping them, and they're going and buying oil and gas from Russia.""

After months of waffling between confrontation and conciliation toward Moscow, Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies — Rosneft and Lukoil — in October as the Kremlin backed off from talks to end the war with Ukraine.

TRUMP FREEZES OUT PUTIN FOR LACK OF ‘ENOUGH ACTION’ TOWARD PEACE — FUTURE TALKS UNCERTAIN

""Every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations, and then they don’t go anywhere,"" Trump said in October when announcing the sanctions. ""They just don’t go anywhere.

""I just felt it was time. We’ve waited a long time,"" Trump added when asked why he chose to impose the sanctions at that time and not sooner.

The sanctions came after a planned meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in October was called off.

Orbán, who has a longstanding warm relationship with Trump, in October called the sanctions imposed by Trump ""a mistake,"" from Hungary's perspective.

""We are thinking about how to build a sustainable system for the Hungarian economy because Hungary is very dependent on Russian oil and gas. And, without them, energy prices will skyrocket, causing shortages in our supplies,"" Orbán said in October during a meeting with Italian leaders in Rome.

AFTER WAFFLING BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, TRUMP SLAPS KREMLIN WITH OIL SANCTIONS

Orbán told the media his discussion with Trump Friday will include the exemption request, explaining that the pipelines transporting oil and gas are ""vital"" to the nation because it is landlocked and that he will negotiate the matter with the White House.

Trump told the media that he and Orbán agree the war between Russia and Ukraine — which has raged since 2022 — will end soon, adding, ""The basic dispute is they just don't want to stop yet. And I think they will. I think it's taking a big toll on Russia.""

The pair said it would likely take a ""miracle"" for Ukraine to win the war.

Trump praised Orbán during the meeting as a ""great leader,"" namely on his strict immigration policies .

""The fact is that he's a great leader, and he's respected all over,"" Trump said. ""Not necessarily liked by some of the leaders, but, you know, those leaders have proven to be wrong.

""If you look at his stance on immigration and other things, you know, if you look at Europe, they made tremendous mistakes in immigration. It's really hurting them very badly. He has not made a mistake on immigration.""

Orbán also commended Trump, arguing ""everything was ruined"" by the Biden administration while celebrating Trump's return to the White House.

""The reason why we are here to open a new chapter between the bilateral relations of the United States and Hungary, basically, because during the Democrat administration, everything was ruined,"" he said.

""So, after your leaving president, everything was basically blocked, ruined, canceled. A lot of harm done by the previous administration. In the last ten months, president, what you have done, we are very much grateful for that. You restored the old level of the relationship. You improved the bilateral relation. You repaired what was done badly by the previous administration,"" Orbán said."

Duffy said there will be a lag of several days to a week before airlines and airports can return to normal operations.

""It’s going to take some time for the airlines to respond. So once we see more controllers in the towers, then the airlines have to respond to that,"" Duffy said. ""It can be days, if not a week, before we get back to full-force flights when the shutdown ends.""

Senate Majority Leader John Thune , R-S.D., opted to keep the chamber in session for a rare Friday vote, with the idea being to put the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) on the floor for a 15th time.

However, after Senate Democrats met behind closed doors on Thursday and exited their meeting with a renewed sense of unity, Thune raised the concern that, ""We’ve got to get the Democrats back and engaged.""

'TWISTED IRONY': DEMOCRATS RISK BETRAYING THEIR OWN PET ISSUES WITH GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN GAMBLE

Bipartisan talks among several Republican and moderate Democratic senators had picked up significantly in the last week, with rays of hope that an end was near that could cut through the fog of the shutdown .

But Tuesday’s election sweep and pressure from progressives and more left-leaning members of the Democratic caucus have possibly tripped up progress in those talks.

""All I know is that the pep rally they had at lunch yesterday evidently changed some minds,"" Thune said. ""I thought we were on a track. We were giving them everything they wanted or had asked for, and at some point, I was gonna say, they have to take yes for an answer, and they were trending in that direction. And then yesterday, everything kind of — the wheels came off, so to speak.""

Thune’s remarks came as a flurry of activity was happening behind-the-scenes. The plan was to advance the CR and then add a trio of spending bills in a package known as a minibus, but a series of counteroffers and demands from Senate Democrats have slowed momentum.

OPTIMISM FADES AS SENATE DEMOCRATS DIG IN, HOLD OUT OVER OBAMACARE DEMANDS

But some in the Senate GOP don’t appear too keen on the idea of putting the same bill on the floor again without real progress being made.

""There’s no reason to vote on the same stuff that we voted on in the past just to do it again,"" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said.

It also comes as the Senate creeps toward a scheduled recess for Veterans Day next week, and as questions linger on whether Thune will keep lawmakers in town over the weekend. If there's no CR vote on Friday, it could be punted until Saturday.

""Our members are going to be advised to be available if, in fact, there's a need to vote, and we will see what happens and whether or not over the course of the next couple of days, the Democrats can find a way to reengage,"" Thune said.

A possible second option could be voting on a bill from Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wis., to ensure that federal workers and the military would get paid as the shutdown drags on. That bill was blocked by Senate Democrats last month, and since Johnson has workshopped it with his colleagues across the aisle, he plans to offer an amendment that would include furloughed federal workers into the mix.

MIKE JOHNSON SHOOTS DOWN OBAMACARE VOTE GUARANTEE AFTER THUNE FLOATS COMPROMISE IN SENATE

He said in a statement to Fox News Digital that he hopes to pass the bill Friday through unanimous consent or a voice vote, two fast-track methods that don’t require a full vote.

""No Republican senator objects to the bill, and we hope the same is true among the Democrat senators,"" Johnson said. ""If not, we will call for a roll call vote to reveal which senators are willing to use federal workers as political pawns and jeopardize the safety and security of the American people.""

The core of Senate Democrats’ demand is to see an extension to the expiring Obamacare subsidies in exchange for reopening the government.

Thune and Republicans offered a vote on legislation for the subsidies only after the government reopened, but many Senate Democrats view that as not enough. For now, the chamber is in limbo until a play call is made.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital that ""it seems Republicans don’t know what they want to do.""

""This thing could be solved in an hour,"" he said. ""What is their resistance to just stopping these premium increases from going into effect? I mean, this is so insane.""

""There's a tremendously twisted irony,"" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., told Fox News Digital.

John Feehery of EFB Advocacy, who served as press secretary to former Republican House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert, said, ""The most unbelievable thing"" about the shutdown is Democrats ""hurting their own constituents.""

""Democrats never shut the government down. This is the first time they've ever done this. I mean, they've let the Republicans shut the government down, but they've never done it on purpose,"" he said.

MIKE JOHNSON UNDERCUTS JOHN THUNE ON OBAMACARE NEGOTIATIONS TO END SHUTDOWN

As Senate Democrats have pushed the shutdown into the longest on record, they still aren’t ready to reopen the government, even as millions who rely on food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are only set to get partial benefits.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., and his caucus have remained firm in their demand that they get a guarantee to extend expiring Obamacare premium subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government.

Democrats have blasted President Donald Trump and his administration for threatening to not fund federal food benefits. Earlier this week, Trump said that food stamps would not be funded despite a court order requiring that they at least be partially paid for.

""They're the ones who shut down the government,"" Lummis said. ""They won't reopen it, and so they got nothing to complain about. It's within their control to reopen the government. It's in their control.""

His administration has since changed course, however, and announced in a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that Americans that rely on the benefits would receive 65% of their typical allotted amount. A federal judge then ordered the administration to fully fund food benefits by Friday.

""We're finding out that it's hurting the union workers, it's hurting air travelers, it's hurting people who rely on food stamps. I mean, it's hurting Democrats,"" Feehery said. ""Their higher priority is showing that they're tough against Trump, and they're more than happy to use their constituents as cannon fodder.""

SCHUMER, DEMS CALL 'BULL----' ON TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER FOOD STAMP SHUTDOWN THREAT

Democrats acknowledge that the pain of the shutdown can’t be ignored but remain firm that their fight to extend the healthcare subsidies is one worth having.

""Shutdowns suck. I want it over here, but I don't think we have fully come to recognize how much pain is going to exist in this country when 4 million people lose their healthcare insurance,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said. ""That's as devastating, if not more devastating, in the long run, than the pain people are feeling this month.""

Julian Epstein, former chief counsel for House Judiciary Committee Democrats, told Fox News Digital that Republicans had an opportunity to seize the narrative on healthcare.

""If I were advising Trump, I would tell him to make the case in an Oval Office address that the Democrats are voting to close the government and that it's the Republicans that want to open it. The president should also lay out his vision for controlling healthcare premiums,"" Epstein said. ""Voters are starting to tune out the invective from both sides, and all the noise. They want a clear plan for their economic concerns.""

And Feehery similarly argued Republicans should take their moment on healthcare, pointing out that Democrats are effectively delaying the discussion on Obamacare by prolonging the shutdown.

""If Republicans were smart, they would be talking about why Obamacare is fundamentally broken and how to fundamentally change that. But Republicans don't really like to talk about healthcare, which is kind of annoying,"" he said. ""But yeah, I do think that the fact that it's gone past the [Nov. 1 open enrollment] deadline has made this even more complicated.""

There is a sense on Capitol Hill that the shutdown could be coming to an end, but Republicans contend it will be up to Senate Democrats.

A dozen centrist Democrats are mulling an offer from the GOP that would guarantee a vote on the expiring subsidies after the government reopens, coupled with the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) and a trio of spending bills to jump start the government funding process.

SENATE DEMS EMBOLDENED IN SHUTDOWN STRATEGY AFTER ELECTION SWEEP

But many in the caucus say that’s not enough, and demand that Trump sit down and meet with Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to hash out a deal.

Democrats also believe that Republicans are feeling the heat from Tuesday night’s elections, where Democratic candidates swept their Republican opponents in statewide elections, and they point to comments Trump made that the shutdown was hurting the GOP.

Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., contended that what Trump meant was Democrats were using the shutdown ""to fire up their base.""

""But I think it's also incredibly sad that SNAP recipients and federal workers and their families and Head Start families all had to go without so they could help the New York City election ,"" Lankford said. ""And that's pretty sad.""

Meanwhile, Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., who is running for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, told Fox News Digital, ""Every day the Schumer Shutdown drags on, Americans pay the price — missed paychecks, canceled flights, and threats to public safety. Democrats aren’t helping anyone, they’re sowing chaos and achieving nothing.""

Still, Democrats largely remain firm that the only off-ramp they want starts at the White House.

""Shutdowns are terrible. I mean, I don't know what to tell you,"" Sen. Bryan Schatz, D-Hawaii, told Fox News Digital. ""It's really awful what people are going through. And the only way out of this is a negotiation.""

The high court found in a 6-3 order temporarily greenlighting the policy that a lower court in Massachusetts had erred in blocking it.

""Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth—in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,"" the majority wrote in the unsigned order.

TRUMP ADMIN ASKS SUPREME COURT TO ALLOW IT TO ENFORCE PASSPORT SEX DESIGNATION POLICY

The three liberal justices dissented. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Biden appointee, blasted her Republican-appointed colleagues in a lengthy dissent for what she said had become a ""routine"" of siding with the Trump administration on the emergency docket.

The majority ""fails to spill any ink considering the plaintiffs, opting instead to intervene in the Government’s favor without equitable justification, and in a manner that permits harm to be inflicted on the most vulnerable party,"" Jackson wrote, adding that transgender people have been permitted to state their preferred gender on passports for more than three decades.

The class action lawsuit, brought by a dozen self-described transgender, nonbinary or intersex people on behalf of themselves and others in their situation, will continue to proceed through the lower courts.

The plaintiffs had argued in court papers that passports should ""reflect the sex [people] live as and express, rather than the sex they were assigned at birth.""

SUPREME COURT REJECTS SOUTH CAROLINA'S BID TO ENFORCE TRANSGENDER BATHROOM BAN

Solicitor General John Sauer wrote on behalf of President Donald Trump that passports effectively communicate information to foreign governments and private citizens cannot force the president to communicate in a way that defies his foreign policy preferences and ""scientific reality.""

The policy, which reversed the Biden administration's allowance of an ""X"" gender option on passports, was implemented as part of a string of executive orders Trump issued when he took office aimed at requiring transgender people to identify as their biological sex in certain situations, including in gender-exclusive sports and in the military.

Attorney General Pam Bondi celebrated that the high court had handed the Department of Justice roughly two-dozen wins this year on the emergency docket, sometimes referred to as a shadow or interim docket, where cases are fast-tracked so that the Supreme Court can potentially offer temporary resolutions until the merits of the cases are examined.

""Today’s stay allows the government to require citizens to list their biological sex on their passport,"" Bondi said on social media. ""In other words: there are two sexes, and our attorneys will continue fighting for that simple truth.""

""Young people are struggling. I look around at my friends and my peers, and they're not sure if they're ever going to be able to start a family or buy a home,"" Fox News contributor Brett Cooper said Thursday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""All of that seems very, very out of reach for most young people, so when you start talking about free things and the economy and affordability, it doesn't really matter who you are or if they actually understand the systems that are behind those promises… they are running with it.""

Mamdani, like President Donald Trump , made the affordability crisis a cornerstone of his campaign, promising to work toward a more affordable New York City for all residents.

SEN. SLOTKIN SAYS DEM SOCIALIST NYC CANDIDATE MAMDANI REPRESENTS 'NEW GENERATION' OF LEADERS YOUNG VOTERS WANT

Cooper doesn't believe Mamdani will be able to deliver on those promises but urged the GOP to ""lean in on"" concerns Gen Z voters have about unattainable rites of passage like homeownership or starting a family.

""I think Republicans need to lean in on that. We need tangible change for young people, otherwise we're going to lose them,"" she said.

Gen Z voted in large numbers for Mamdani, a self-avowed Democratic socialist who made anti-Israel and anti-capitalist sentiments key components of his message.

I’M FROM GEN Z. WE ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE TO STOP SOCIALISM FROM TAKING OVER

Cooper suggested professors and college curricula are to blame for Gen Z's progressive shift.

""It's this complete victimhood mentality of, 'this is the way the economy is, and you can't work hard to claw your way out of it,'"" she continued.

""'You can't pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You are oppressed forever. You're never going to be able to buy anything.' And when you hear that for years and years, you adopt that mentality.""

Campus Reform reporter Emily Sturge also attributed Mamdani’s win to the progressive ideas shaping young voters on college campuses. She warned that Gen Z isn’t a group the GOP can afford to ignore.

""For over a decade, we've been sounding the alarm… that the higher education system is indoctrinating young minds with this sugar-coated view of socialism while also demonizing capitalism,"" she said on ""Fox & Friends First.""

Sturge added that the left is playing into the empathy of young female voters, using issues like immigration and abortion to earn their support.

""But you know what? I'm very optimistic. This is not a generation that we can write off,"" she told co-host Todd Piro.

""Just a year ago, Generation Z helped fuel President Trump's return to the White House. Generation Z shifted to the right. And within the past ten or so months of President Trump being back in the Oval Office, I've reported how Generation Z, as they've shifted to the right, have shifted toward faith, family, conservatism, Christianity, even a boom in patriotism, so I do have a lot of optimism when I look at young people today.""

Lawyers for the Justice Department asked the First Circuit Court of Appeals to temporarily stay an injunction handed down one day earlier by a federal judge in Rhode Island. The appeal is the latest in an ongoing court fight over the food aid program that funds 42 million low-income Americans.

U.S. District Judge John McConnell ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday to allocate $4 billion in alternative contingency funds as needed to fully fund the SNAP program through November, noting the urgency of the food aid and the need for distribution.

The judge also scolded the Trump administration for agreeing to fund just 65% of the SNAP benefits. ""It’s likely that SNAP recipients are hungry as we sit here,"" McConnell said Thursday shortly before issuing the new order, which gave the USDA less than 24 hours to comply.

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES TRUMP MUST FULLY FUND SNAP PROGRAM BY FRIDAY

In their filing Friday to the First Circuit Court of Appeals , Trump's legal team argued that the lower court order ""makes a mockery of the separation of powers,"" and accused McConnell of overstepping his powers as a federal judge.

""There is no lawful basis for an order that directs USDA to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions,"" DOJ lawyers argued, describing his order as an ""unprecedented injunction"" and one that ""makes a mockery of the separation of powers.""

TWO JUDGES RULE TRUMP ADMIN MUST KEEP SNAP BENEFITS IN PLACE AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

""This is a crisis, to be sure, but it is a crisis occasioned by congressional failure, and that can only be solved by congressional action,"" they added.

McConnell on Thursday also said the Trump administration had failed to comply with his original order last week, which required USDA to fund the SNAP benefits before its funds were slated to lapse on Nov. 1, the first time ever in the program's 60-year history.

The government ""did nothing to ensure that the money would be paid on Wednesday,"" he said.

The judge also said Trump officials failed to address a known funding distribution problem that could cause SNAP payments to be delayed for weeks or months in some states.

The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Olentangy Local School District, near Columbus, cannot punish students for using gender-specific language, even if some find it offensive.

Parents Defending Education, a national parental rights organization, sued the district in 2023, arguing its pronoun mandate violated students’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. District officials maintained the policies were designed to curb bullying and promote inclusion.

In its majority opinion, the court said the district ""fell far short"" of showing that allowing such speech would cause disruption or infringe on others’ rights.

RED STATE ARGUES TRANS BATHROOM CASE WILL BE 'DEATH KNELL' FOR LEFT-WING AGENDA

""Our society continues to debate whether biological pronouns are appropriate or offensive — just as it continues to debate many other issues surrounding transgender rights,"" Circuit Judge Eric Murphy wrote for the majority. ""The school district may not skew this debate by forcing one side to change the way it conveys its message or by compelling it to express a different view.""

In her dissent, Circuit Judge Jane Stranch avoided using any gendered pronouns, writing that adapting to new linguistic norms ""may be new for some"" but remains ""entirely possible."" She noted that social customs around pronouns ""have evolved throughout American history.""

NYC SCHOOLS SUE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OVER NEARLY $50M IN GRANT CUTS DUE TO TRANSGENDER POLICIES

The decision overturns a 2024 ruling from a separate Sixth Circuit panel that had sided with the district. The case now returns to U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley in Columbus, who must issue an injunction blocking enforcement of the policy.

District rules discouraged students from using language related to gender that could be seen as disrespectful or demeaning, and urged them to use classmates’ self-identified pronouns instead.

A separate policy governing students’ use of personal devices extended those restrictions beyond school grounds, prohibiting content that could be interpreted as harassing or disparaging toward others’ gender identity or sexual orientation.

It remains unclear how widely the ruling will apply. An Ohio teachers’ union told the court that Olentangy’s policies resemble those in other districts across the state.

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., avoided answering whether he would support eliminating the filibuster , as he did under President Joe Biden on Wednesday.

Raskin was asked by CNN's Dana Bash about President Donald Trump's recent comments regarding several Republican losses nationwide Tuesday night and the ongoing government shutdown.

""One of the things that he has been talking about for the last couple of days more intensely is getting rid of the filibuster. That’s actually something that you wanted to do when Joe Biden was president. Things weren't getting through the Senate. So is that an area where you agree with him?"" Bash asked.

DAVID MARCUS: NOW IS THE TIME TO NUKE THE FILIBUSTER

""Look, we don’t need a procedural fix at this point,"" Raskin answered. ""We need the Republicans to recognize that there’s a healthcare crisis they’ve imposed on the country. Millions of people are facing the loss of their health insurance because of the skyrocketing premiums under Trump and the end of the ACA tax credits.""

He continued, ""We need to restore those credits, and we need to restore millions of people to Medicaid that were thrown off when they passed a trillion-dollar cut to healthcare in America, while they gave a trillion-dollar tax break to the wealthiest people. That’s why we’re seeing a clean Democratic sweep across America.""

""So you wanted the filibuster to be ended when Biden was president, but now no?"" Bash interrupted.

""You know, I’m not in the Senate, so I’ve got no say in that, right?"" Raskin said.

He argued that Republicans need to ""come to the table"" and reopen the government to restore Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to people nationwide.

Fox News Digital reached out to Raskin's office for comment.

SENATE GOP RESISTS 'NUCLEAR OPTION' AS DEM SHUTDOWN STANDOFF DEEPENS

Raskin had supported eliminating the filibuster in 2021 after Senate Republicans blocked the formation of an independent panel to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

How did he do it?

By motivating men, young men in particular, and sports fans who were fed up with the insanity of men winning women's sports championships. I wrote about the victory in my new book, "" Balls ,"" which was released on Tuesday.

The book addresses the landslide Trump victory, but it also asks an important question when looking forward prospectively: Now that Trump, unfortunately, isn't able to run for re-election, how do Republicans ensure that the Trump MAGA coalition extends, and even grows, beyond his own presidency?

THE RESULTS ARE IN: 2025'S BIGGEST WINNER AND LOSERS FROM THE OFF-YEAR ELECTIONS

In 2024, the two most conservative voting groups in America were male senior citizens and young men under the age of 30.

This has never happened before in any of our lives.

It was a cultural transformation overnight.

Trump also won record support among White, Black, Asian and Hispanic men as well, but that same momentum didn't extend to 2025. Indeed, Tuesday's voting results paint an ominous picture of what 2026 and 2028 could look like if young men aren't motivated to show up and vote like they did in 2024.

Consider the numbers: in 2024, Trump received 1.968 million votes in New Jersey and 2.075 million votes in Virginia. While he lost both states by narrow margins to Kamala Harris — by roughly 5% — he received more votes than the Virginia Democrat candidate for governor, Abigail Spanberger — who won Virginia with 1.961 million votes — and the New Jersey Democrat candidate for governor, Mikie Sherrill — who won New Jersey with 1.792 million votes.

So how did both Democratic gubernatorial candidates win election comfortably despite receiving fewer votes than Trump did in their states a year ago? Yes, partly because it was an off-year cycle and overall turnout trended down, but they won comfortably because roughly 600,000 Trump voters didn't show up to vote in 2025 who did show up to vote in 2024.

NEWT GINGRICH: REPUBLICANS HAVE ONE BIG THING TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR 2025 WIPEOUT

Who are these voters?

Young men, sports fans, blue collar workers, the Trump MAGA base that will come out to support Trump when he's on the ballot, but won't show up when he's not on the ballot.

So will these voters return in 2026 and in 2028 when Trump isn't on the ballot? That depends on how well future Republican candidates speak to these voters. Some of y'all will think I'm crazy for telling you this, but as soon as the 2026 mid-term elections are over, expect a pivot so rapid it will make your head spin — Democrats in 2027 will all argue that Trump's unique political gifts end with him, that MAGA is over without Trump as its leader. Yep, from ""He's Hitler!"" to ""He's the most talented Republican president in any of our lifetimes,"" almost overnight.

I'm telling you, it's coming.

Because Democrats are going to bank on Trump as a political unicorn, a candidate so talented that only he could power a coalition as substantial as he won in 2024.

MARK PENN: DEMOCRATS WIN THE MOMENT, BUT LEFT-WING TILT THREATENS THEIR FUTURE

So what do Republicans need to do to extend and even grow Trump's appeal with young men? I think it's a combination of three things, wed the policy and the personal together, as Trump has been uniquely talented at doing.

It was as easy as EBC.

Trump won the arguments on all three of these fronts. So far, Trump 2.0 has ended the border as an issue by ending illegal immigration and driven crime down to record lows in many states and cities. His challenge on the economy is that Biden was so bad, it's taking time to clean up his mess. With record high stock prices and record low gas prices, Trump is delivering for all of us with stock market assets and all of us who have to fill up our tanks.

DEMOCRATS SEE MANDATE AFTER 2025 WINS — REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S A MIRAGE

But there's a lingering anger over how much goods cost. Even I feel it each time I buy a Chick-fil-A meal for my family, and it costs over $50. For fast-food, really!

Prices went up so fast under President Joe Biden that the sticker shock is still real even in 2025. Trump has stopped the rapid price increases and, in the case of some purchases like gas, has actually brought them back lower than they were during Biden, but that bitter aftertaste of inflation takes time to wear off.

So far it hasn't.

Is it the most important issue in the country?

No.

But it crystallizes the absurdity of Democrat policies for young men and sports fans, who provided the fuel to Trump's record win in 2024 .

If you believe a man should be able to win a women's sports championship, how can I trust your opinion on anything? As I wrote in "" Balls ,"" this issue, combined with EBC, won Trump the election in 2024.

I think that will still be the message in 2026, too, because, amazingly, Democrats have doubled and tripled down on defending men in women's sports all over the country.

This issue isn't going away.

My two favorite moments of the 2024 campaign were when Trump dressed up as a McDonald's employee and as a garbage man and rode around in a garbage truck.

Was it absurd and ridiculous?

Of course.

But the number one gift Trump has that he receives zero credit for is this: HE'S FUNNY!

Yes, politics are serious. But they should also be fun. Trump is a happy warrior and happy warriors win.

The two most successful Republican presidents of my life were Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. Both were, in many respects, professional entertainers. They knew how to cut through the noise and were authentic in the way they did so.

Trump isn't perfect, none of us are, but he's the most comfortable president in his own skin that any of us have ever seen, and he has tremendous political instincts.

You can spend a hundred million on an ad campaign and not get the free media attention that Trump did, scooping out fries and talking with voters at the drive-thru in Pennsylvania. That style of politicking is unbeatable. Heck, I would argue the best version of Trump is the one you get in fast-food restaurants. He genuinely loves getting out and interacting with people. That's a skill that can't be taught, but it can be emulated.

We used to ask the question, which candidate would you rather have a beer with? While Trump doesn't drink — as he's jokingly said, can you imagine what he'd say if he drank? — he's authentic and real. As artificial intelligence takes over much of the country, I believe authenticity will become the most important political key to the realm.

Young people in particular, who are steeped in social media artificiality fed to them constantly on their phones, have an innate sense of when they're being poll-tested and marketed to, they sniff it out better than older voters.

If you want them to show up and support you, you have to win their trust.

Which is why I truly believe the election was over when it came to male voters when Trump was shot in Butler, Pennsylvania .

In that moment, having escaped death by half an inch, Trump, whose critics had labeled him a phony, rose up and screamed, ""Fight, fight, fight!"" three times. At that instant, the election was over for male voters.

It was the bravest presidential moment of my life.

But it was also one of the most authentic.

In times of great peril, your own personal character is revealed. In those perilous milliseconds, Trump became a legend and won the election.

He proved once and for all he had "" Balls .""

And so far no Democrat has proven that they do.

So long as that remains the case, Republicans aren't going to lose men.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-foe-boasberg-hit-articles-impeachment,fox,Trump foe Boasberg hit with articles of impeachment,Elizabeth Elkind,2025-11-04T14:21:09-05:00,"FIRST ON FOX: Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, is formally introducing impeachment articles against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Tuesday for his role in the ""Arctic Frost"" probe .

Republican allies of President Donald Trump have been criticizing Boasberg after news broke that he was the judge who signed off on subpoenas and other measures in former special counsel Jack Smith’s probe.

""Chief Judge Boasberg has compromised the impartiality of the judiciary and created a constitutional crisis. He is shamelessly weaponizing his power against his political opponents, including Republican members of Congress who are faithfully serving the American people within their jurisdiction,"" Gill told Fox News Digital.

""Judge Boasberg was an accomplice in the egregious Arctic Frost scandal where he equipped the Biden DOJ to spy on Republican senators. His lack of integrity makes him clearly unfit for the gavel. I am proud to once again introduce articles of impeachment against Judge Boasberg to hold him accountable for his high crimes and misdemeanors.""

MAJOR PHONE CARRIERS REVEAL JACK SMITH'S SUBPOENAS FOR REPUBLICAN SENATORS' RECORDS

Gill's resolution accused Boasberg of one count of abuse of power, according to text obtained first by Fox News Digital.

""Ignoring his responsibility to wield the power of his office in a constitutional manner, Chief Judge Boasberg granted Special Counsel John L. Smith authorization to issue frivolous nondisclosure orders in furtherance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation project codenamed ARCTIC FROST,"" the text said.

""These nondisclosure orders covered Members of Congress who were acting in accord with their legislative duties and privileges guaranteed by Article 1, Section 6, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution.""

WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS?

The redacted Arctic Frost documents were made public late last month by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. They included subpoenas of phone records for 10 senators and one House lawmaker, and gag orders sent to Verizon and AT&T instructing them not to notify lawmakers of the subpoena. Verizon complied, but AT&T did not.

Both the subpoenas and gag orders were signed by Boasberg, according to the documents — a detail that prompted fresh criticism and indignation from Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who blasted the investigation as ""worse than Watergate"" and a gross violation of prosecutorial powers.

Under the Stored Communications Act, federal judges exercise discretion in signing off on such orders — they are not automatic. It is unclear what materials Boasberg would have reviewed in this particular case before authorizing the tolling records of the senators, as much of the information and materials in the probe remain classified or are heavily redacted.

Republicans named in the subpoenas have argued they are potential violations of the speech or debate clause of the U.S. Constitution, which protects lawmakers from being arrested or questioned by law enforcement for things they say or do in their legislative roles.

The protections are absolute for legislative acts, though courts sometimes dispute what qualifies as legislative.

It is not the first time Boasberg has caught negative attention from Trump or his allies.

The federal judge was the target of Republican impeachment threats earlier this year after he issued an order temporarily pausing Trump’s migrant deportation flights to El Salvador.

Gill and other GOP lawmakers pushing impeachment resolutions backed off of those threats after House Republican leaders suggested it was not the most potent route to affect change.

California voters are deciding whether to pass a ballot proposition which would dramatically alter the state's congressional districts, putting the left-leaning state front-and-center in the high-stakes political fight over redistricting that pits President Donald Trump and the GOP against the Democrats.

California state lawmakers this summer approved a special proposition on the November ballot to obtain voter approval to temporarily sidetrack the state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democrat-dominated legislature. Early voting by mail in the contest has been underway for a month.

LIVE UPDATES: ELECTION DAY 2025

The effort in California, which could create five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts, aims to counter the passage in the reliable red state of Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats. Failure to approve what's known as Proposition 50 would be a stinging setback for Democrats.

OBAMA ENDORSES NEWSOM CALIFORNIA REDISTRICTING PROP 50

Two-term Gov. Gavin Newsom , who is seen as a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender, is spearheading the push to pass the proposition.

""If we lose here, we are going to have total Republican control in the House, the Senate and the White House for at least two more years,"" Newsom emphasized in a recent fundraising appeal to supporters. ""If we win here, we can put a check on Trump for his final two years.""

The push by Trump and Republicans for a rare mid-decade redistricting is part of a broad effort by the GOP to pad its razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.

Trump and his political team are aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections.

Missouri last month joined Texas as the second GOP-controlled state to pass congressional redistricting ahead of next year's elections. The new map in Missouri is likely to give the GOP another right-leaning seat.

And North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature also passed a new map, which is likely to score another congressional seat for the GOP. Republican-controlled Indiana is on deck, with a special legislative session getting underway this week.

But unlike those states, California voters need to weigh in before giving redistricting power back to the legislature in Sacramento.

""Heaven help us if we lose,"" Newsom said in a fundraising pitch. ""This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for Democrats.""

FIVE KEY 2025 RACES TO WATCH

Proponents and opponents of Proposition 50 raised hundreds of millions of dollars in fundraising , with much of the money being dished out to pay for a deluge of ads on both sides.

One of the two main groups countering Newsom and the Democrats labeled their effort ""Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab.""

Getting into the fight was former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who was the last Republican governor of California.

During his tenure as governor, Schwarzenegger had a starring role in the passage of constitutional amendments in California in 2008 and 2010 that took the power to draw state legislative and congressional districts away from politicians and placed it in the hands of an independent commission.

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VOTERS WEIGH IN ON PROP 50 REDISTRICTING FIGHT

""That’s what they want to do is take us backwards — this is why it is important for you to vote no on Prop 50,"" Schwarzenegger said in an ad against Proposition 50. ""Democracy — we’ve got to protect it, and we’ve got to go and fight for it.""

But as Election Day neared in California, the Yes forces had dramatically outraised the No forces, and public opinion polling indicated majority support for the proposition.

Even before Trump initiated his redistricting push, Ohio was under court order to redraw its maps. That could boost Republicans in a one-time battleground state that now leans right.

Republicans in GOP-dominated Florida are also mulling congressional redistricting. And Democrats in heavily blue Maryland are weighing a redistricting push, while the Democrat-controlled legislature in Virginia is already pushing redistricting.

Other states considering altering their maps are Democrat-dominated Illinois and red states Kansas and Nebraska.

Meanwhile, Democrats could possibly pick up a seat in Republican-dominated Utah, due to a new, more competitive map, mandated by a judge.
